  "description": "Though retired from service for a long time before the Jump Gate shutdown, the push to give any advantage to the Federal and Republic fleets in their fights against the Xenon and the Holy Order of the Pontifex has seen the long-serving Elite redesigned as an interceptor.\\n\\nQuick in a straight line and able to fire off short bursts of fire-power before disengaging, the Elite often targets small ships and slower missiles, as well as using its speed and size, in support of the dog-fighters that are able to hold out longer under fire.",
