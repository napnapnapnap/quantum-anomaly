{"id":"ship_ter_l_destroyer_01_a_macro","class":"ship_l","race":"ter","name":"Osaka","basename":"Osaka","description":"This state of the art version of the Osaka-class destroyer is the result of meticulously redesigning and overhauling its predecessor model. The design retained the two-pronged front bow of the older ship, while adopting an elongated rear section more typical of contemporary Terran designs.\\n\\nDestroyer-class ships usually play an important role in engaging large enemy targets, while also serving as an anchor point for larger fleet movement. The Terran Protectorate's Osaka, however, specialises only in the first of these two roles, leaving coordination duties to the fleet's carriers and battleships.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"destroyer","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_l","hull":95000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":2,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":3,"medium":10,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":10,"missile":160,"people":75,"countermeasure":20,"deployable":250,"capacity":2800,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":202.028,"inertia":{"pitch":100.346,"yaw":100.346,"roll":80.277},"drag":{"forward":80.406,"reverse":321.623,"horizontal":71.355,"vertical":71.355,"pitch":107.406,"yaw":107.406,"roll":107.406},"thrusters":{"size":"large"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":40},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true}],"shields":{"size":"large","quantity":3},"engines":{"size":"large","quantity":2,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":10058790,"average":11833870,"max":13608951},"production":{"time":187,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"281"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"1034"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"471"}]}},"manufacturer":"pioneers"}
