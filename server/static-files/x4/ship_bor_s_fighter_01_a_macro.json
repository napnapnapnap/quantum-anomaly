  "description": "The Mako fighter was the second Menelaus Era ship developed by Faded Dreams Defences. As with their prior project, the company could draw upon its experience with Split encounters in the Faded Dreams system. After two years of successful development, and shortly before its ambitious release scheduled in 788 NT, the company's Mako fighter prototype was stolen by Boron pirates from Barren Shores. This raised serious security questions with the Royal Boron Navy and lead to various audits. As a result the Boron parliament introduced new security requirements for companies working on government contracts. After upgrading their security to the new standards, Faded Dreams Defences continued development and successfully released the Mako fighter in 789 NT. The fate of the stolen prototype remained unknown, as its incorporated technology was not leaked to other parties.\\n\\nMenelaus Era ships were built between 785 NT and 798 NT as a second wave of more autonomous ships in preparation for the Jump Gate shutdowns. To reduce flight mass, the ships are mostly filled with air, requiring Boron crew to wear protective suits. The new Menelaus cabinet allowed corporations, working under a government contract, access to various classified technological advancements made by Royal Boron Military Defence research facilities. The ships designed with those technologies are less sturdy than the first wave of Atreus Era ships, but more manoeuvrable.",
