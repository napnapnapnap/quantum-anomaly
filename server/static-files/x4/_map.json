          "description": "This sector is notable for the fact that before the Jump Gate network went down, experts observed an unusually high number of active warp anomalies in the area. The high frequency of such occurrences could indicate an inherent instability in this region of space that might prove dangerous someday. If, however, science could learn to harness this cosmic volatility, the practical applications of this phenomenon would be sure to change space travel significantly. For this reason, the sector remains a point of interest to scientists, and experiments are occasionally conducted, even though the intensity and frequency of anomalies seems to have decreased significantly over time.",

Nevertheless, being denied access to other systems for trading purposes, and the resulting lack of profits, weighed heavily on their collective psyche. Long before the shutdown, the Teladi Company's board of directors drafted a comprehensive dossier of business rules to act as a guide to the Chairmen supervising their systems. These business rules covered, among other things, how to conduct business in case of such a disruptive contingency. Following these guidelines, the Company was able to scale down business to meet demand and minimise loss by making redundancies. Some of the Teladi workforce who found themselves jobless as a result, would eventually join the ranks of the Scale Plate Pact.",

The system's namesake skyscraper, 'The Grand Exchange', is used to coordinate trade throughout the universe. While repeated Kha'ak attacks and the Jump Gate shutdown temporarily slowed down communication, regular activity was eventually resumed.\\n\\nThe Grand Exchange skyscraper constitutes a potential critical vulnerability which, if exploited by hostile entities, could debilitate the economy.

During his studies, Nopileos programmed an AutoBroker, which made a quick profit of 18 billion Credits on the stock market. Knowing that excess profits made before he turned 16 would be taken by the Teladi Company as payment for his education, Nopileos instead donated this money to a charity supporting Boron orphans. While the charity received more Credits than the Queendom of Boron's annual budget, Nopileos was expelled for hiding money from the Teladi Company. To this day, the Teladi are still astonished by the great achievement of an underling, but similarly shocked by the altruistic use of this capital. Following in Nopileos's steps, small groups of Teladi in this sector try to live by his example.\\n\\nA later marketing endeavour by the Teladi Company tried to tie the sector's name to the alleged 18 billion Teladi casualties in the first great Xenon conflict. The Teladi Company still claims that the sector's name is referring to this incident.",

          "description": "After mysterious hints by a certain non-profit organisation appeared around the outskirts of Hewa's Twin soon after the Jump Gate realignment, some Teladi took it upon themselves to search the network and document any and all further clues they could find in the official publications that had just begun to spring up as part of the Explorers Guild portfolio. When one particularly excitable individual claimed to have found strange and intricate markings on asteroids in an as yet unclaimed gateway system, the hunt was on. For some time, it became commonplace for young Teladi to make a trip to the hunting grounds at least once and add their exaggerated discovery stories to their culture's collective memory.\\n\\nUnfortunately, it was inevitable that at some point an entomologist would visit the sector and, with great regret, inform the treasure hunters that the asteroid markings, while spectacularly well preserved and absolutely invaluable to the scientific community, were left by migrating spacefly swarms which had burrowed their way out of these asteroids to begin their search for a new home.\\n\\nThe sudden wave of disappointment quenched the spirit of adventure and rapidly depopulated the system, save for a handful of colonies which had already been established by especially eager prospectors who weren't too keen on voiding the fruits of their commitment just yet. Over time, these settlements grew, and as the original reason for their arrival faded into utter insignificance, some members of the communities whose livelihoods were founded on the detritus of a system-wide treasure hunt realised that, through them, whoever left those initial hints all over the network had already achieved their goal. Years after the rush, a convoy of refugees from Scale Plate Green would arrive in the largely abandoned space, already charted meticulously and filled with decrepit stations, to make their home.",

Before the shutdown, pirates used to go out of their way to take upon themselves the arduous journey into the system, enticed by the rich pickings its remote position and instability provided. Nowadays, cut off from the other Argon systems and situated in close proximity to Teladi space, this sector makes for an even more attractive target.",

          "description": "As one of the first never-before-seen systems that fell into the lap of the Federation during the realignment, The Reach still holds a special status in Argon history. When the connection flickered into activation, Fleet Command immediately cast its net wide in an attempt to uncover potential Jump Gates leading further into the depths of space. To facilitate this grand expansionary effort, the newly discovered system was to be transformed into a densely colonised foothold; an initiative that was selflessly supported by many of the more influential, wealthy families of Argon Prime. After an initial dispute over equitable distribution of real estate which was settled by the Federal Presidency, officially tying these entitlements to unalterable obligations as part of the colonisation process, the system saw a steady influx of settlers. However, just a few months later, the spotlight of attention shifted away from the once-promising colony. As more and more gates began to reopen, federal interest in The Reach rapidly dwindled, transforming it into the quiescent backwater system of today. To budding explorers and entrepreneurs, this new status carries with it a number of obvious benefits, most notably including an as yet comfortable distance to any military threats, which allows them to test their skills in a relatively forgiving environment. Moreover, the comparatively long period since its discovery has given the local aristocrats ample opportunity to build up a quasi-feudal power structure, turning the system into a slow and steady supplier for the local economy.",

Its relatively close proximity to Argon, Godrealm and Split systems offers a wealth of opportunities for trade and profits. So, it comes as no surprise that the system's promise of a bright future makes it a valuable point of entry for many newly established enterprises looking to step up and gain a foothold in the Commonwealth. Due to this situation, it has become synonymous with entrepreneurial optimism in the face of what is too often a bleak universe.",

To the dismay of their strategists, the scattering of supposedly unprepared enemy patrols put up an unexpectedly strong resistance, dragging out the encounter and foiling the attackers' plans of swift conquest. Surviving Paranid pilots claim that at the peak of the skirmish, the True Pontifex himself appeared before them, directing individual ships towards enemy blind-spots with unprecedented precision; a phenomenon which continues to be reverently described as a gift of “True Sight”. Regardless of the actual sequence of events, the invaders were forced to withdraw, and the system was ordered to be thoroughly fortified as both first line of defence and last bastion against the Argon threat. According to Holy Order officials, the True Pontifex went into seclusion after this event, becoming the imperious, yet elusive, figure the galactic community knows today.",

          "description": "The Teladi homeworld of Ianamus Zura was long lost to the spacefaring Teladi people. As a result, a few cultural and economic aberrations can be observed between the two groups. Whereas the entirety of the spacefaring Teladi population is female, Ianamus Zura is notable for being home to both male and female Teladi. The presence of Teladi males results in a stronger, more supportive family network. This allows for more individual downtime. That time is spent, more often than not, in the pursuit of arts and philosophy, which their spacefaring cousins have very little patience for. The Ianamus Zura governing system is more akin to a parliamentary democracy than the Teladi Company's corporate structure.\\n\\nSince Ianamus Zura's connection to the rest of the universe was severed for a long time, the Gate shutdown did not affect its inhabitants as severely. In fact, the planet thrived in isolation. When it was reconnected again, these Teladi found themselves in close proximity to Xenon. They were not well-equipped to deal with such an imminent threat, but with assistance from the Ministry of Finance they were eventually able to adapt to the new reality, after some initial struggles.",

It took the fleet some time before they encountered the Xenon that were operating deep within this system, far from the Gate. The scouts soon came to the realisation that they were surrounded by hostile forces, and at that point they were far from any reinforcements. Their natural flight instinct came to the fore and they hastily retreated towards the Gate that lead back to their homeworld. Many ships were picked off by intercepting Xenon along the way, but a few ships made it back. Unfortunately, their failed exploration drew the Xenon closer to the Jump Gate, and Xenon attacks have now become a common occurrence.",

For this reason, little is known about the planet contained within it. While it appears to be a planet barren of vegetation, some suspect it to be rich in ore, hidden beneath the surface layers. Despite these speculations, no one dares go near it, since trying to settle it would surely result in being targeted by the Xenon.",

This makes the sector an attractive mark for criminals and pirates, who can use the superhighway as a convenient getaway to quickly slip into less-regulated space. Should these criminals be caught, the Godrealm of the Paranid shows no mercy to the offenders. Their code of law is among the strictest in the known universe. Because of this, pirate raids are incredibly risky, but they also promise great reward. These incursions usually happen within the blink of an eye, and can be overwhelming to the victims of the pirate raids.",

For nearly twenty years, the Gate network would unpredictably disconnect and reroute gates before it stabilised. During this time, developing this sector was a risky undertaking. All expeditions had to be self-sufficient, as they could not rely on the Gate to remain open once they passed through. Additionally, Accelerators had to be set up to reach required resources far from the Jump Gate. Nevertheless, the Paranid took that risk and sent expeditions into this system. They were arguably well-rewarded, as the expeditions helped later development and the sector turned into an important crossroads in the Gate network.",

While Sol remained connected to the Jump Gate network, Heretic's End remained under heavy Terran protection, but when it became obvious that Jump Gates were failing too quickly for the connection to possibly remain stable, the system was swiftly abandoned, fading back into obscurity. Now, it serves as a backwater colony that holds only interest to pirates and smugglers.",

As far as the cartographers can tell, it was never encountered before the Gates reconnected. It does not appear in any official documentation or corporate travel logs. Yet, when the network stabilised and the Argon Federation sent out scouts to survey the adjacent systems for activity, not only did they find a heavy Xenon presence, but also the remnants of vast structures stretching throughout the system. Surprisingly, these networks do not seem to be of Xenon origin, and raise the question of what exactly happened in this system.",

Behind the various pirate leaders was a guiding hand, the self-proclaimed Pirate Duke who, faced with the sudden collapse of all outside communication, harnessed the indomitable spirit of his followers and led them towards colonisation. As the years passed by after the shutdown, the once-warlike Buccaneers became content with their new purpose, while Lasting Vengeance similarly flourished in an era of relative peace and prosperity. Few remember when the dreaded armaments of Duke's Haven and its fleet fell silent for the last time.\\n\\nWhat happened to the pirate operation in the years that followed remains unknown.

When the Paranid set out for distant space, the high priests who stayed behind nominated a new Cardinal for spiritual guidance. When the Gates shut down, it was that Cardinal whom the isolated Paranid population turned towards. He led them well, and the resident Paranids would see the system be reconnected to the greater Paranid realm.\\n\\nHowever, tensions arose when the system's Paranid were confronted by the fervent Holy Order, who would not tolerate another religious authority who did not follow their Pontifex's teachings. The Cardinal did something almost unthinkable when he converted and stepped down from his leadership duties. In doing so, he avoided otherwise certain conflict and saved countless lives. This decision did not go over well with the Godrealm, who, upon learning of his betrayal, set a considerable bounty on his head.",

It was only after the Accelerator connection was established that the engineering fleet learned about the Jump Gate shutdown in this system that had left them stranded and disconnected from the Godrealm of the Paranid. When the engineers rejoined their brethren in Pious Mists II II, an ambitious Duke was already in control of the first fleet. Despite the looming imperative of establishing self-sufficiency in this still largely unexplored system, they fought a violent conflict over the nature of their government. The Paranid loyal to the Godrealm overthrew the self-proclaimed Duke and emerged victorious. The survivors tried to carry out their mission, but due to the scarcity of functioning equipment following the conflict, they were forced into hibernation in cocoons. One watcher stayed awake to endure until the Gates reactivated and reunified this expedition with the Godrealm, making sure nothing unforeseen would harm their sleeping brethren. But when the Gate reactivated, the Godrealm found this watcher dead and only learned the expedition's fate from their logs. The cocoons, however, were never found. The pious Paranid of the first expedition are still believed to be hibernating somewhere in this system.",

This naively romantic assessment disregards the history of unease that followed the system's discovery by a legendary adventurer. Her sudden fame bestowed upon the system an unexpected and unprecedented surge in intergalactic attention. The prospect of inadvertently falling behind eventually pressured all major factions to ignore the threats lurking in this remote area of the network and construct large stations to stake their own claims. The fortunate beneficiaries of this peculiar arrangement were the many explorers that followed the spirit of the system's original discovery, and who now had a straightforward way to outfit their ships with state-of-the-art equipment and software from all major factions. During a period of interim administration, in which the Argon company TerraCorp set out to improve the system's infrastructure with new accelerator technology, Getsu Fune was hit by the repercussions of the collapsing Gate network, and all contact was subsequently lost.\\n\\nAfter the Jump Gate realignment, the system was once again found to be barren and initially provided a bleak outlook on the current chances of peaceful coexistence. However, recent analysis of the many drifting station wrecks has produced matching signs of a meticulous deconstruction of the key structures, which might well point towards a joint effort between the system's many diverse inhabitants. The purpose of this undertaking, which likely took place shortly after the shutdown, and the whereabouts of the settlers, are yet to be determined.",

Notwithstanding a striking lack of evidence of settlements on this particular celestial body, wild stories of secret mining facilities, ancient technology and gaseous alien life have already begun to circulate, and the Teladi Company has registered a sudden but welcome rise in the sales of resource probes.

Apart from offering a convenient narrative regarding the downfall of yet another Scale Plate Pact cartel, this story also aligns with the bodily reactions of the earliest explorers. Soon after the sector had rejoined the known network, a group of Boron enthusiastically arrived in search of a potential gate connection to their lost homeworld. Upon entering the curious nebula, they reportedly drifted into a state of contemplative melancholy, induced by hallucinatory vapors permeating through their ship's olfactory sensor membrane. After returning to Teladi space, the explorers spoke little about what they had encountered, other than to claim that the \"thin veil of reality\" supposedly hid a \"world in blue-magenta, flecked with pink\". It is said that this transcendent experience inspired the composition of a commemorative song.",

Ambitious lesser families used the fact that Dhiok was cut off from the Patriarch of all Split's main domain to their advantage, and staged a siege on the regent Patriarch's seat of power. They chose to starve him out because Dhiok's defences were heavily fortified. To the besiegers, it was apparent that a direct attack on the station would lead to severe casualties on both sides, and was not a certain victory. But eventually, they grew restless and bored. The Patriarch of Family Zhin, leader of the revolt, feared that his coup would soon lose momentum, so he stepped up to challenge the regent to single combat in order to end the stalemate. Worried that he would dishonour himself and lose the support of the remaining loyal Split families, Patriarch Dhiok had no choice but to accept. The duel was swiftly carried out, and resulted in Zhin assuming control.\\n\\nWhen the Jump Gates reconnected, and Zhin was approached by Patriarch Zyarth, he was initially hesitant to relinquish sovereignty, but soon realised that his military would not stand a chance against the combined forces of Patriarchs Zyarth and Nhuut. Cautious not to repeat his predecessor's arrogant mistake, he yielded to Patriarch Zyarth to maintain a modicum of authority and power within the patriarchal structure.",

Family Njy had a reputation of using ruthlessly ambitious tactics to gain any advantage over their adversaries. They often rigged their ships' engines with explosive devices to inflict coordinated damage on their opponents' carriers when they came into range. It was not uncommon for the crews stationed on the rigged ships to be oblivious to their strategies. Incredibly successful at first, their conduct eventually alienated them from their fellow Split families. When Patriarch Zyarth's fleet approached their Gate, Family Njy realised too late that they stood alone. They were succeeded by the family Kritt, who were careful to not repeat their predecessors' mistake. They swore fealty to the new Patriarch of all Split, Zyarth, and made an effort to reach out to other families residing in the system.",

They are unruly, and despite the Patriarch of all Split's tight grip on his empire, infighting is a common occurrence. It is only tolerated because this system is on the periphery of the Split empire, and the short bursts of violence do not escalate into sustained conflicts that might rope in larger parts of the Patriarchy. One family that often takes part in these skirmishes is the family Phi. They used to be regarded by other resident families as somewhat of an unofficial authority in the region, but with the Paranid continuing to establish a presence in the system, and Zyarth's interference and insistence on creating a stable order, the Patriarch Phi has lost much of its former standing.",

Not at home in any single system, they instead preferred to make a living raiding traders and other Split families. When the Gates shut down, they were scattered, and became more of a nuisance than an actual threat to the stability of the Patriarchy. However, as the Split systems started to reconnect, and the situation concerning the Free Families began to deteriorate, Patriarch Zyarth was worried about how much more dangerous the Free Families could be if they ever joined forces with Family Valka. To get ahead of this potential problem, Patriarch Zyarth offered the Valka pirates control over Wretched Skies. In terms of standing, this was a considerable step up for Patriarch Valka. He quickly assumed the role of jailer, maintaining and guarding the system's prison colonies.",

They were held responsible for an incident on their shipyard, which left over five hundred Split dead in its wake. This caused a loss of honor, and the other families quickly turned their backs. Additionally, the destruction of the shipyard left their economy crippled. They would have faded away, were it not for the Patriarch of all Split at the time recognising the value of an indebted and fragile family in close proximity to Teladi systems. The Family Tkr was offered protection from the other families by the Patriarch as long as they supplied him with slaves and resources from outside Split space. Split politics are a chaotic affair, and the historic records are muddled, but some scholars have proposed theories that the shipyard incident might not have been an accident, but targeted sabotage, to keep an ambitious family in line.\\n\\nMore recently, Patriarch Zyarth has made significant efforts to fold Family Tkr back into his empire. He recognised that despite their lowly status they are a still an important factor in the Split hierarchy, and losing their support would shake up the fragile dynamics of power.",

Nowadays, its proximity to several Jump Gates makes it the centre of the Free Family territory. As a result of its position, Tharka's Ravine XXIV XXIV was the immediate choice for Zyarth to establish a colonial presence. The Patriarch of all Split set out, without hesitation, to build the Hall of Judgement , from which police operations could be coordinated. This impressive station also serves as a seat from which to judge and execute potential insurgents. Understandably, it is looked upon by the Free Families as a monument of oppression rather than as an institution working towards peace and stability.",

Velk commanded the only military force in this system that could rival Zyarth's, and was a close advisor to the Patriarch of all Split, Rhonkar. Zyarth bode his time until he was certain that Velk would be left to his own devices. When the moment came, he struck decisively and with all his might.

They are notable for displaying a very militaristic and expansionist attitude, even for Split standards. They ruthlessly take over smaller families, and fold them into their own military, which is ceaselessly growing. Patriarch Zyarth has arranged an uneasy alliance with Nhuut, and heavily relies on their military backing to scare the smaller families into obedience. Many wonder if Zyarth would be able to reign in the Nhuut Family should these underlying tensions ever explode to the surface, or if his reckless reliance on them as his enforcers might lead to his undoing.",

The traders who made this system their home, are notoriously tough, and ruthless. This can be attributed to their close proximity to the Split families, and the lawlessness and piracy surrounding them. When Jump Gates shut down, the Teladi in this system were left to their own devices, and their conduct shifted further away from that of the regular Teladi Company. In order to survive the isolation, they increased trade with the Split and tailored their supply to the Split's needs for labour. Upon reconnecting with the larger Commonwealth, many Teladi from outside the system voiced their unease about their connection to the slave trade.",

Its proximity to Split territory, small size, and its inherent vulnerability, make it a primary target for any Split family looking for easily obtained slave labour. Since the realignment, those Argon citizens who have not yet been captured or killed by the Split have widely started fleeing the system, looking towards the stability and security the Argon Federation can provide them. Many of these refugees are forced to leave behind everything they possess when they set out for safety. Only very few stoic or brave pioneers remain behind to face the encroaching Split.",

Most recently, it has become the main theatre in the conflict between Patriarch Zyarth and the Free Families. When the Gates reconnected, the Free Families turned this system into its first line of defence against Zyarth. Patriarch Zyarth, however, is pushing into that space, and recently won a historic battle, delivering a crippling blow to the Free Families.",

At first they experimented with austere, spatially efficient housing complexes in the crevices of tethered asteroids. At some point, while deconstructing a freighter to attach its life-support systems to one of these asteroids, the ordained priest engineers found that they could modify its shield generator output, significantly lessening the protection from physical impact but at the same time greatly expanding the shield coverage; a discovery which they believed would consecrate their settlements against the metaphysical threats present in the system. Over the following two decades, more and more station complexes sprang up that used this adaptation of shield technology to facilitate the construction of large, specialised screen modules able to protect their habitation units. Even though the threat of radiation has since been disproven to a certain extent, there is no doubt that these sprawling heaps of metal served to distract the invading Xenon during the Jump Gate realignment, buying the system's inhabitants enough time to escape.",

The commanding Prior Admiral ordered his staff to engineer a solution, and in a spur of lateral thinking uncommon for the Paranid, one of them declared a grand proposition that would ultimately bring the conflict to its decisive conclusion. The fleet's resources were immediately pooled to retrofit a construction vessel that was originally reserved for setting up the system's Defence Platform, and the monstrously armed result was sent off into the void in the direction of the presumed origin of the Xenon attacks. Upon arrival, the oversized construction vessel, in a display of artful Paranid ingenuity, blossomed into a Superhighway Gate. With their main advantage of distance removed from the equation, and an endless stream of holy fervour pouring from the new sector entry point, the Xenon and their production facilities were quickly eliminated.",

Their mission was doomed to fail anyway, for even if they had reached the gates in time, they would have found them disconnected.\\n\\nAfter the Gates resumed functioning, other Split families claimed the system for themselves, and soon realised that the Family Tharka line had come to a violent end.

Patriarch Rhy was a proud and respected ruler who kept his subjects in line throughout the isolation brought upon them by the Gates shutting down. He maintained a tight network of allies, the most notable of which was the Patriarch of all Split, Rhonkar, whom Rhy served as a spymaster in his expansionist campaigns. Rhy could trust his patron to keep the other Split families from making moves against him. This secure situation changed considerably when the Gates reactivated again, and Rhy found himself in close proximity to Xenon territory.\\n\\nHe reached out to Rhonkar for help, but he soon realised that he was on his own. Patriarch Zyarth had overthrown Rhonkar and was looking to establish himself as the uncontested ruler of Split society. He offered Patriarch Rhy a helping hand, but only under the condition that he subject himself to Zyarth rule. The proud Patriarch refused the offer. Instead, he mounted a final defence against the encroaching Xenon invaders. Some Split subjects fled the system, looking to join the newly established Free Families, but most stood their ground until the very end.",

Some welcome the challenge of battling such a viciously dangerous foe; others are frustrated at the fact that it seems impossible to win the war and eradicate the self-replicating machines in their entirety. They hold the belief that there is no honour in killing a thing without consciousness. Patriarch Zyarth recognises the Xenon in this system as a tool to put pressure on other Patriarchs and secure their obedience. Additionally, his vast experience in engaging the Xenon proved helpful to him when the time came to subjugate his rival Patriarchs in combat.",

High above this settlement, a breathable atmosphere was established using a particle layer, which also protects the surface from the Sun's radiation and keeps its temperature steady.\\n\\nThe space around Mars is also of vital importance to the Terran military. Previously home to the USC, the military industry in this sector is responsible for some of the most respected ship designs in the Terran fleet. These days it is still the base of operations for the Terran Protectorate's war efforts, and since it is the outermost sector with access restrictions, it also serves as a barrier between those regions of Sol that are accessible to the majority, and the more well-guarded, gated sectors surrounding Earth.",

Terran civilisation created the original Terraformer fleets, which later evolved to become the Xenon, and built their own Jump Gates before stumbling upon the existing Jump Gate network; deeds unparalleled within the Community of Planets.\\n\\nThe safety of Sol was always the prime Terran mandate. Under the United Space Command Earth was guarded by the Torus Aeternal, an imposing orbital ring station. Now, as only wreckage of the Torus Aeternal remains, the Terran Protectorate safeguards Earth and its surrounding space with decentralised patrols and access restrictions. Even regular Sol citizens can be denied passage, if they lack the Protectorate Inner Core Access Licence.",

When the Sol system fell back into the isolation and the Terran government reorganised itself, the assignment of threat assessment was gradually shifted to the Mars-based Terran Secret Service.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the Torus incident, the Terran government was keen to severely limit access to Earth by travellers and workers from all over the universe, so Saturn now acts as the administrative hub of the Sol system.",

The space surrounding Uranus has some potential despite its remote location, far from the Sol system's core, but that potential remains unfulfilled, so it is home only to those who do not have better alternatives available to them.",

Its remote location was also the reason why Neptune was chosen as the location for the third gate to be created by Terran engineers. Its intended function was to re-establish contact with Terran colonies outside the Sol system, in an attempt to maintain some influence over Commonwealth politics.\\n\\nAs a result of hosting this additional gate, the sector also came to serve as the logical point of origin for the Pioneer Initiative, which was sent out to further develop Brennan's Triumph and the outer rim of Sol, and which would eventually evolve into the Segaris Pioneers.",

          "description": "Almost entirely devoid of life, this difficult-to-access sector is under complete Xenon control. Only a small contingent of Yaki pirates has, against the odds, managed to survive in this hostile territory. The Paranid-built superhighway enables their raiding parties to quickly access Antigone space and the fringes of the Sol system. However, its missing return lane does make returning to the Yaki base of operations an arduous and potentially dangerous task. The proximity to the Xenon, while unsafe, also has also proven to be the Yaki pirates' greatest asset. Hidden behind several Xenon systems, they are undisturbed by law enforcement, who would never dare venture this deep into Xenon space, so, as long as they can manage to maintain their fragile symbiosis with the Xenon, they can go about their business in relative safety.",

          "description": "Before the Jump Gates ceased to function, the Paranid reportedly tried to reclaim Savage Spur, which was in close proximity to their core systems, for themselves. Their first step was to construct a superhighway, in the hope that it would make policing the hostile system easier, and that Paranid forces could more flexibly respond to pirate activity. When Antigone Republic explorers rediscovered Savage Spur II after the system reconnected, they soon found, with some puzzlement, that one of the superhighway's directional lanes had vanished. It is theorised that the highway was collateral damage in the fight between Xenon and Kha'ak forces. However, this explanation does not account for the peculiar fact that subsequent patrols did not come across any remnants, such as drifting debris, suggesting perhaps a more deliberate method of disassembly.",

When they lost contact with Earth, most of these settlers would eventually travel further into the gate network to establish a government in Argon Prime.\\n\\nAfter the system's invasion and the tragic razing of Taurus during the First Terraformer War, the surviving colonists fled, leaving the system uninhabited. When the Xenon were pushed out of the system, Brennan's Triumph became a haven for piracy - most notably the organised slave trade - much to the dismay of the Argon Federation, who repeatedly attempted to put an end to this criminal activity. While the Argon Federation failed to regain control of the system, the Jump Gate shutdown would prove disastrous for the resident pirate groups. Since their economy relied exclusively on raiding neighbouring system, it completely collapsed when those systems became inaccessible.\\n\\nWhen the Terran government established a new connection between Neptune and Brennan's Triumph, they sent the Pioneer Initiative in to colonise the system. Now, the Segaris Pioneers are happy to have claimed it for themselves, despite its troubled history.",

They used to share it with a community of wandering scientists, who became stranded when the system was cut off from the gate network. Not much is known about these enigmatic but peaceful nomads, since they mostly kept themselves to themselves. What is known, however, is that they were intensely focussed on researching the Tide phenomenon once it emerged. They conducted experiments and took measurements in the furthest reaches of Avarice, far from Tidebreak and the shelter it offered. Many of them lost their lives to the Tide in the pursuit of knowledge. Eventually, when the Riptide Rakers had not heard from the nomadic scientists for several weeks on end, they realised that the group had disappeared entirely. The scientists left behind only a few research instruments, and a ship prototype that the Riptide Rakers would later claim for themselves. Attempts by the Rakers to pick up where the scientists' research left off, or to make use of the equipment they left behind, have ultimately proven fruitless. Between the relentlessly recurring Tide and the attentions of desperate scrappers, most traces of their existence have long since been dismantled.",

The resulting waves of stellar particles ripping through the system are colloquially referred to by the local inhabitants as \"the Tide\". Despite the great speed at which the Tide advances, it takes a few moments to engulf the entirety of the system. Avarice V V Dead End is the sector furthest away from the centre of the system and, as such, is afforded some advanced warning of its approach; other sectors are hit at barely a moment's notice.\\n\\nAnother notable feature of Avarice as a whole, but especially this rather remote sector, is that it plays host to an unusually large number of space-time anomalies. These anomalies began to appear during the latter half of the system's period of isolation, but their number seems to have grown significantly since the gate resumed its function. Whether the increase in the number of anomalies was triggered by the re-connection to the Jump Gate network, was caused by some sort of inherent instability of the system, was in some way connected to the emergence of the Tide, or was even entirely coincidental, is a topic of much debate amongst scientists and scholars.",

          "description": "The impact of the first Tide took most of the inhabitants of the Avarice system by surprise. Many ships were destroyed outright, and the repeated waves would quickly also take their toll on larger, more fortified, constructions such as stations. The only object that turned out to be capable of withstanding the Tide was an abandoned mining facility which had been drilled into the side of a massive asteroid in Avarice IV IV, and which the Riptide Rakers soon repurposed as an austere but functional shelter. The majority of the inhabitants of Avarice flocked to this place of sanctuary, which became known as Tidebreak, leaving vast regions of the system uninhabited. Since the people living in Tidebreak could not venture far from their safe haven, the population lived in poverty and had to make do with scraps, and whatever resources they could gather in the intervals between Tides.\\n\\nFor a long time, Tidebreak was the only reliable shelter from the Tide's forces. This only changed when new technology appeared, seemingly out of nowhere. A new substance began to be distributed by the hitherto completely unknown Northriver Company. This substance, called Protectyon, has unique properties that allow it to be used as fuel by the Riptide Rakers, to create protective shields powerful enough to withstand the intense stellar energy pulsing through Avarice. Thanks to this technology, the entirety of the Avarice system has since been reclaimed. In order to provide continuous protection, the new shield generators have to be regularly resupplied with small quantities of Protectyon, an incredibly rare and expensive substance. Stations which cannot afford to pay are left to fend for themselves and the people on these unprotected stations then fall victim to the Tide. The Northriver Company, being the sole supplier, has grown incredibly rich and powerful as a result, and while the conditions in Avarice have improved considerably since Protectyon was introduced, the situation remains incredibly volatile.",

Largely gone were the obscene displays of wealth, and the luxurious-looking space stations of the past. Instead, they were met with the skeletal relics of old marvels. And whereas their envoys used to be met with good will and gifts by the rich communities that were once in charge, they were now met with open hostility by the criminal gangs that constituted the new leadership.\\n\\nUnderstandably, relations between Windfall and its neighbours have cooled significantly. Fearful that outside influence would disrupt the delicate system that had established itself during the period of isolation, the biggest criminal organisation, the Vigor Syndicate, seized the opportunity and united several other criminal groups under its banner. The unruly nature of the system also led many smaller bands of pirates to use Windfall as a staging ground for their raids into Argon and Teladi space, and as a retreat where they could disappear off the radar of the law. It remains unclear why the Ministry of Finance and the Argon authorities refrain from occupying this lawless thorn in their side. Perhaps it is because their offensive capabilities are required more urgently elsewhere, or maybe some back-channel deals have been made to keep them out of the system.",

          "description": "The new arrangement of the Jump Gate network means that this sector of the Windfall IV Aurora's Dream system provides the only entry point into the Avarice system. Scavengers of the Riptide Rakers, as well as commonwealth traders, passing through Windfall to access Avarice are often harassed by the Syndicate and other smaller bands of criminals. This results in the exchange of wares between Avarice and the outside network being somewhat sparse. The close proximity to Riptide Rakers' space also resulted in a scrapyard being built in this sector by the Vigor Syndicate. Impounded ships are stripped of anything useful and then stored, to be accessed for scrap metal at a later date.\\n\\nIt is also of note that the Vigor Syndicate enforce a complete monopoly on all food production and distribution in their space. This policy was initially lobbied for by the Solid Ice Union, a conglomerate of Ice mining companies stranded in Windfall, who went on to form one notable wing of the Vigor Syndicate. Some argue that the policy is meant to prohibit resource extraction by outside forces with more technologically advanced mining ships, now that the connection has been re-established. Others point out that by disallowing any transportation of food whatsoever, other than that sold by their own traders, they have effectively erected a soft trade blockade and made the people of Avarice dependent on their products, which they naturally sell at a premium. Ironically, this has led to some Raker ships smuggling contraband food through pirate territory.",

          "description": "Windfall IV IV Aurora's Dream is notable for housing the Aurora Casino, which is the largest gambling establishment in the network. It used to be the shining centrepiece of culture, to which the rich business people and socialites who originally settled the system flocked. During the period when the system collapsed into lawlessness, the station never ceased to function entirely, but maintenance was somewhat neglected, and the exterior lost much of its visual splendour. Nowadays, the casino is a big part of the Syndicate's push to attract outsiders to their system. They hope that the promise of a quick fortune will attract both potential new business partners and easy marks.\\n\\nWhile patrons gamble away their salaries in the ostentatious lobby of the casino, shady deals take place in the back rooms. The Aurora serves as a hub for criminals from all walks of life. As such, it has become a first point of contact for anyone looking to strike a deal with the Vigor Syndicate. Since the connection between Avarice and Windfall was first established, the Syndicate have been offering loans to desperate Riptide Rakers who find themselves unable to maintain their stations by other means. Naturally, they charge interest, and anyone who cannot afford to pay them back on time finds themselves in deep trouble.",

          "description": "Once a bustling trade colony, Barren Shores was most notable for being a reliable source of ore. The system's exports would find their way to the furthest reaches of the commonwealth. Unobstructed, streamlined trade was of such importance that scientists carried out a project to move a Jump Gate away from an inconveniently located belt of asteroids. This was done to optimise travel times, exemplifying Boron ingenuity and their commitment to not only further scientific progress, but also to reach out to the network's peoples as best they could.\\n\\nUnfortunately for its residents, the system suffered gravely from being disconnected. While initially ore was plentiful, the system lacked many of the other materials that were required to maintain a healthy economy. As the years passed the deposits of ore began to deplete. With no alternative source, the system now threatens to become truly barren. Some of the more spiritually-minded inhabitants cannot help but wonder whether the administrator who initially named the system had some sort of prophetic insight into what could come to pass.\\n\\nToday, many Boron have abandoned space for the relative comfort of the nearby planet of Menehune. The Provinces Adrift administration attempted to ship planet-bound resources into orbit, to aid the failing economy, but it became painfully clear that they were missing the infrastructure and manpower for even such a comparatively trivial task. Transporting resources off-planet is becoming a more and more unattractive proposition with each passing day, as more Boron give up on their aspirations of interstellar habitation. Impressive feats of scientific ingenuity, such as moving a Jump Gate, have long become unthinkable as the last remaining inhabitants struggle to support themselves in their daily lives.",

          "description": "This former major Queendom colony has evolved from a ship construction hub to the seat of the temporary Provinces Adrift government. From here, the makeshift alliance of various local political figures is trying to keep its Boron charges alive. Although this interim government does enjoy the trust of its citizens, many Boron have given up on trying to make a living in space. Instead, many have chosen to settle down on the local Planet of Nakshatra. This drain of manpower has put an additional strain on the Provinces Adrift's already severely weakened economy.\\n\\nDespite the state of their economy, the Boron of Great Reef are trying unwaveringly to maintain a baseline of ship production. To this end, the administration has begun a cooperation with Atreus Shipbuilding Currents. Although smaller vessels are built with somewhat frequent regularity, the Boron are still struggling to reliably maintain a shipyard.\\n\\nBefore the system's connection to the Queendom was severed, piracy was a serious issue. Raids on the ships entering and leaving this space were constant. Thankfully, and somewhat counterintuitively, the frequency of Boron pirate attacks has significantly decreased during the period of isolation. The question of whether the cause of this development can be traced back to a significant decrease of attractive targets, or if it is yet another display of inherent Boron solidarity in the face of adversity, is as yet unsettled.",

          "description": "Formerly a Xenon system, Sanctuary of Darkness became infested with Kha'ak during the Jump Gate Shutdown. The repercussions of its connection to Great Reef were dire, and felt immediately. Kha'ak forces spilled out into the largely unprepared Boron systems. It is unclear why the Kha'ak in this system were so exceptionally aggressive. Most suspect that it was due to the ongoing mining activity in the Provinces Adrift systems. Others, however, speculate that Sanctuary of Darkness may constitute one of the last remaining Kha'ak safe havens, after Operation Final Fury sought to wipe them from the known network, and that they were only looking to defend their lair. Although the reasons for their frequent, but largely uncoordinated, attacks were unclear, it is even more uncertain why they eventually ceased. Without any means of communicating with one another, it appears that the two neighbours now nonetheless live in a very fragile state of undeclared truce.\\n\\nThe system itself is as inhospitable as it ever was. A nearby star creates a dangerous environment that makes it an unsuitable target for colonisation efforts. The system's current dwellers may be mysterious, but the star is downright puzzling. Its signature has led scientists to suspect that it was not formed naturally, but was instead manufactured artificially. There is currently no consensus among the scientific community regarding who could have created this phenomenon, nor is it clear for what purpose it was created.",

As far as most Boron historians are concerned, it was on this day that the Queendom of Boron officially joined the Alliance of the Word.\\n\\nIn 808 NT, the local Jump Gate reactivated, which concluded Kingdom End's period of complete isolation. Though the local \"bubble\", as the Boron called it, remained modest in size for the time being, this event at least gave the Queendom a sorely needed influx of resources, and the first physical pathway to reconnect with other Boron worlds.

          "description": "Once the limited Jump Gate network around Kingdom End had stabilised, the Boron were faced with the challenge of reintegrating the recovered planets, Jamshala and Ayeshma, into the Queendom's diminished economy. At the same time, the Boron tendency towards discovery and xenophilia gave rise to a popular movement advocating for a revitalisation of the Jump Gate research project, which had been discontinued to preserve resources during the time of isolation. Aided by the energetic, yet mediating, presence of Polypheides, who had barely been Queen for half a decade by that point, the parliament on Nishala unanimously passed this radical resolution.\\n\\nThe next message drone sent towards Sacred Relic laid out the Queendom's plans to experiment on, and ultimately reactivate, the Kingdom End Jump Gate. Over the following years, the towering wave of optimism and excitement slowly subsided, as the scientists involved became aware that the scope of this goal would in all likelihood exceed not only their own lifespans, but those of the next generation as well. Not only were they apparently lacking a crucial piece of insight, unobtainable at their current technological level, but they also realised that gathering the energy required for a proper attempt at opening the Jump Gate would drain the Queendom of resources to the point of risking economic collapse. This was a sacrifice neither they nor Queen Polypheides were willing to make.\\n\\nAs such, parliament decided that modest, yet steady, contributions to the Kingdom End Jump Gate installation were to be made a fundamental part of the Queendom's regular expenditures. Apart from regular systems checks and test transmissions, experiments were put on hold until a sufficient threshold could be achieved; even if no Boron currently alive would be there to witness it., Ayeshma same as Ayeshma, Nishala same as Nishala",

          "description": "This Boron system suffered widespread devastation during a Xenon offensive. Many of its inhabitants were able to flee, but those unlucky enough to be caught on the planet Samsara perished before they had a chance to react. Both the planet, and the wider Boron population, were left devastated in the wake of the Xenon assault.\\n\\nEventually, when the Xenon forces moved on, the Queendom was able to reclaim the system for themselves and pick up the pieces. The system held no strategic significance, nor was it particularly resource-rich. This has led to a great deal of speculation and confusion among the Boron on whether this historic tragedy was a calculated attack or pure happenstance. One theory is that the Xenon seemed to target the planet specifically, causing such unnecessary suffering to these Boron, just in order to conduct initial tests on their experimental planet-killer weapon; a weapon which they would go on to use to great effect later, in the Second Xenon Conflict.\\n\\nOnce the Boron had rebuilt, Ocean of Fantasy was transformed into a successful hub for farming and mining. The revival initiative was launched by Atreus Shipbuilding Currents, who were looking to establish more branches in the known network. Although the influx of trade revitalised the system, the scarred planet remained an inhospitable memorial to those who had lost their lives.\\n\\nThe cessation of trade brought about by the system's isolation caused ship production to come to a complete halt. Only after the formation of the Provinces Adrift, were attempts made to resume shipyard operations. However, ever-prevalent ware shortages were further amplified when Kha'ak raids started to harass defenceless trade ships trying to deliver critical supplies. These raids went largely unanswered, as the Provinces Adrift were struggling to allocate enough patrols to cover all of their systems.\\n\\nIn an attempt to protect themselves from these raids, several upstanding members of the community came together to organise a grassroots initiative. Traders organised themselves to conduct their trade runs in larger numbers. Nila Ti, a vocal proponent of the initiative, had posited that this would make them less attractive targets. Unfortunately, however, her hypothesis proved to be incorrect, and several such convoys went missing or were destroyed. Eventually, the Boron gave up on trying to maintain Ocean of Fantasy's shipyard and the focus shifted. All ship building was now consolidated into Great Reef. Not only is it situated more centrally within Provinces territory, but producing all ships in one system also makes the system easier to patrol and protect from Kha'ak invaders.",

Due to a stroke of luck, or depending on who one might ask, divine intervention, Atreus' Clouds was among a handful of Boron systems that remained connected to the wider Jump Gate network for several years, before finally becoming isolated themselves. During this time, when the Dark had not yet fully settled in, the planet Jamshala, also called \"Tethys\" by the Argon, became a major hub for the Community of Planets' repatriation efforts.\\n\\nSince the thought of being permanently cut off from each other terrified the communal Boron, word went out to all distant colonies to return to one of the core worlds. Jamshala, with its history of multi-species cooperation, emerged as the obvious choice for those communities who wanted to retain some of their off-world individuality. It was not only Boron who heeded the call to safety, however, and Jamshala's marvellous floating cities are still populated by the descendants of those who opted to stay, or had nowhere else to go., the \"Community of Planets\" was a United Nations-like diplomatic forum)",

However, as the surrounding systems became more conflict-prone, particularly because of the border with the war-like Split, the location was eventually deemed too unsafe for the heir apparent to the Boron throne. Instead, the Boron parliament appointed a royal council to oversee the ever-growing resource shipments to this fledgling part of the Queendom.\\n\\nWhen the Jump Gates began to shut down, Menelaus' Oasis was among the first of the Boron systems to lose their connection to their capital in Kingdom End. Thanks in no small part to the royal council's already well-advanced efforts to import Nishala's flora and fauna, the population of the local planet, Ayeshma, endured, and since its rediscovery, it has once again become a popular tourist destination., Ayeshma same as Ayeshma",
