  "description": "Faded Dreams Defences developed the Irukandji as a military scout for the Royal Boron Navy, drawing on its experience with Split encounters in the Faded Dreams system, which was by then already disconnected. As their first project under Queen Menelaus, the development helped the company to familiarise itself with the new technologies and production requirements provided by the Royal Boron Military Defence. The ship saw its first deployment in 787 NT.\\n\\nMenelaus Era ships were built between 785 NT and 798 NT as a second wave of more autonomous ships in preparation for the Jump Gate shutdowns. To reduce flight mass, the ships are mostly filled with air, requiring Boron crew to wear protective suits. The new Menelaus cabinet allowed corporations, working under a government contract, access to various classified technological advancements made by Royal Boron Military Defence research facilities. The ships designed with those technologies are less sturdy than the first wave of Atreus Era ships, but more manoeuvrable.",
