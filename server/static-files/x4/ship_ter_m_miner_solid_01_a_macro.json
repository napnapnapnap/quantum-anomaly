While the Argon-based Plutarch Mining Corporation developed their initial prototypes, several Sol-based corporations reached the same conclusion independently. When the Jump Gates realigned, both sides tried to sell their technological innovations to the other, only to realise that the market was already saturated.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"miner","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":5000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":1,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":7,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":8800,"capacityType":"solid"},"mass":37.781,"inertia":{"pitch":7.35,"yaw":7.35,"roll":5.88},"drag":{"forward":6.898,"reverse":39.419,"horizontal":15.792,"vertical":15.792,"pitch":11.945,"yaw":11.945,"roll":11.945},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":330429,"average":388740,"max":447051},"production":{"time":15,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"9"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"83"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"38"}]}},"manufacturer":"pioneers"}
