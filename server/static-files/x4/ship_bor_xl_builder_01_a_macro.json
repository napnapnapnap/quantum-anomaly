  "description": "Lucky Planets Construction Enterprises made a name for itself supplying and servicing Boron colonies surrounding the Lucky Planets system. With their experience in the various space engineering fields involved in station construction, the company secured a contract to develop a builder ship in 782 NT. Although development began during the Atreus Era, it continued well into the Menelaus Era thereby spanning the major paradigm shifts in ship design that occurred during that time. Development and construction finished with the first Walrus' maiden voyage, when it undocked from the Lucky Planets Shipyard in 789 NT.\\n\\nMenelaus Era ships were built between 785 NT and 798 NT as a second wave of more autonomous ships in preparation for the Jump Gate shutdowns. To reduce flight mass, the ships are mostly filled with air, requiring Boron crew to wear protective suits. The new Menelaus cabinet allowed corporations, working under a government contract, access to various classified technological advancements made by Royal Boron Military Defence research facilities. The ships designed with those technologies are less sturdy than the first wave of Atreus Era ships, but more manoeuvrable.",
