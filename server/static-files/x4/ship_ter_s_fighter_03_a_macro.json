  "description": "Much like the Kalis, the Takoba came about as the result of Segaris Pioneers engineers' modifications to military ships provided to them by the Terran Protectorate, though in this case the ships were mostly decommissioned examples, sold to the Pioneers at a reduced price. Sleek in design, and distinguished from other fighters primarily by its speed, ships of this class are often dispatched to explore unfamiliar territory in which some enemy presence is expected. While useful for small-scale military action, the Takoba is not as adept at engaging the enemy head-on, as its shielding is somewhat weaker than the Terran fighters on which it was based.",
