  "description": "After their reasonably successful development of the heavy fighter in 788 NT, and a recent incident disqualifying their main competitor, Eleius Astrosecurity secured the government contract to develop the next Royal Boron Navy corvette. Widely regarded as a successful design, the Hydra entered service in 792 NT.\\n\\nMenelaus Era ships were built between 785 NT and 798 NT as a second wave of more autonomous ships in preparation for the Jump Gate shutdowns. To reduce flight mass, the ships are mostly filled with air, requiring Boron crew to wear protective suits. The new Menelaus cabinet allowed corporations, working under a government contract, access to various classified technological advancements made by Royal Boron Military Defence research facilities. The ships designed with those technologies are less sturdy than the first wave of Atreus Era ships, but more manoeuvrable.\\n\\nThe Regal version is a custom build commissioned by the monarchy to be awarded to individuals of outstanding merit.",
