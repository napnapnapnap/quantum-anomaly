Though it is now different from the PMC's original design, the Drill has been in service ever since, inspiring a train of different mining ships to be released all across the old and new Jump Gate network.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"miner","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":4000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":1,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":9,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":9800,"capacityType":"solid"},"mass":32.438,"inertia":{"pitch":10.839,"yaw":10.839,"roll":8.671},"drag":{"forward":4.085,"reverse":23.341,"horizontal":22.934,"vertical":22.934,"pitch":17.097,"yaw":17.097,"roll":17.097},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"112170","average":"131965","max":"151760"},"production":{"time":12,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"69"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"121"}]}},"manufacturer":"argon"}
