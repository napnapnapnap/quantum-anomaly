Designed during the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran Protectorate sought to create a more heavily armed, yet still nimble, gunboat. With its turrets capable of applying pressure in several directions simultaneously, it is easy for the Jian to switch rapidly between targets, allowing it to keep enemy fighter groups at bay.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"gunboat","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":13000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":1,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":6,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":40,"people":8,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":950,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":34.134,"inertia":{"pitch":7.361,"yaw":7.361,"roll":5.889},"drag":{"forward":9.103,"reverse":36.411,"horizontal":11.877,"vertical":11.877,"pitch":11.034,"yaw":11.034,"roll":11.034},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"2366240","average":"2057600","max":"1789217"},"production":{"time":"27","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"49"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"150"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"68"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
