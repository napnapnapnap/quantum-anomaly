{"id":"ship_atf_xl_battleship_01_a_macro","class":"ship_xl","race":"atf","name":"Asgard","basename":"Asgard","description":"The Asgard-class battleship was designed by the ATF to be a moving fortress, capable of taking on even the most monumental Xenon strongholds and capital ships. It is very slow, but also very powerful, and is especially noteworthy because of its unique forward-facing XL Main Battery. This weapon makes use of some unique technology that was specifically designed for the ATF, and is no longer available elsewhere. In terms of raw single-shot damage, it is currently the most powerful gun in the known universe.\\n\\nThis was the last ship class designed and produced by the ATF before the organisation was dissolved and its resources absorbed by the Terran Protectorate. Despite the change in administration, the Asgard is still frequently used by the Terran Protectorate because its sheer firepower has yet to be surpassed.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"battleship","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_xl","hull":275000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":1,"large":2,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":16,"medium":6,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":10,"missile":1160,"people":360,"countermeasure":40,"deployable":450,"capacity":9000,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":487.388,"inertia":{"pitch":485.311,"yaw":485.311,"roll":388.249},"drag":{"forward":133.108,"reverse":532.433,"horizontal":259.232,"vertical":259.232,"pitch":717.73,"yaw":717.73,"roll":717.73},"thrusters":{"size":"extralarge"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":40},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"extralarge","standard":true}],"shields":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":4},"engines":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":1,"shields":{"quantity":4,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"22252932","average":"26179920","max":"30106908"},"production":{"time":"516","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"619"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"2854"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"1300"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
