Unlike his entrepreneurial peers, \"Yaya\" built his wealth through a series of daring scout and courier missions, investing his rewards in other businesses.\\n\\nWhile Teladi youth venerate Yaya for his adventures, few diverge from the traditional mining, manufacturing and trading expectations of their parents.\\n\\nYaya himself is a somewhat shadowy figure, whose purported wealth is obfuscated by an unknown number of shell companies. It is believed that many of his exploits are entirely fictional and, though there are no arrest warrants in his name, it is believed that several police forces would like to have a word with him.\\n\\nThe Guillemot Vanguard is somewhat faster than the basic model and, as such, is thought to be Yaya's preference.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"scout","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_s","hull":2300,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":1},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":3,"countermeasure":4,"deployable":50,"capacity":960,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":9.899,"inertia":{"pitch":2.059,"yaw":2.059,"roll":1.647},"drag":{"forward":6.543,"reverse":31.548,"horizontal":3.187,"vertical":3.187,"pitch":4.5,"yaw":4.5,"roll":4.5},"thrusters":{"size":"small"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"dlc":"base","turrets":[],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"small","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"small","quantity":4},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":118596,"average":139525,"max":160454},"production":{"time":11,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"59"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"129"}]}},"manufacturer":"teladi"}
