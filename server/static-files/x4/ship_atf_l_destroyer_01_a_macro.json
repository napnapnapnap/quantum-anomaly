{"id":"ship_atf_l_destroyer_01_a_macro","class":"ship_l","race":"atf","name":"Syn","basename":"Syn","description":"The Syn-class destroyer is a remnant of the AGI Task Force fleet. With its three front-facing weapons, it was designed to take on large, slow targets. While most other ATF ships were systematically decommissioned and replaced by the Terran Protectorate, the Syn, due to its specialised nature, was absorbed into the Protectorate's military. While the Terran Protectorate developed their own destroyer-class ship, the Osaka, they saw sufficient military value in operating two distinct lines of destroyers side by side.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"destroyer","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_l","hull":119000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":3,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":8,"medium":4,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":10,"missile":160,"people":187,"countermeasure":20,"deployable":250,"capacity":4100,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":124.088,"inertia":{"pitch":107.528,"yaw":107.528,"roll":86.022},"drag":{"forward":48.613,"reverse":194.453,"horizontal":23.482,"vertical":23.482,"pitch":91.818,"yaw":91.818,"roll":91.818},"thrusters":{"size":"large"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":40},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true,"missile":false,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"large","standard":true}],"shields":{"size":"large","quantity":3},"engines":{"size":"large","quantity":1,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"12600383","average":"14823980","max":"17047577"},"production":{"time":"234","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"352"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"1296"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"590"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
