The newest iteration allows for greater modularity and more extensive modification options, and adjusts the design to be more in-line with the Terran Protectorate's modern aesthetic. It also adds an extra turret to make it a less attractive target for pirate raids, and to ensure that no wares critical to the Terran war effort are lost in transit.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"transporter","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"9000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":22,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":10700,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":"72.561","inertia":{"pitch":"13.551","yaw":"13.551","roll":"10.841"},"drag":{"forward":"17.028","reverse":"68.112","horizontal":"26.286","vertical":"26.286","pitch":"20.64","yaw":"20.64","roll":"20.64"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"624206","average":"734360","max":"844514"},"production":{"time":"28","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"17"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"157"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"72"}]}},"manufacturer":"pioneers"}
