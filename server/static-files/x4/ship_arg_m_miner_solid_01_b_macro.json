Though it is now different from the PMC's original design, the Drill has been in service ever since, inspiring a train of different mining ships to be released all across the old and new Jump Gate network.","shortvariation":"BV ST","variation":"\\(Mineral\\) Sentinel","type":"miner","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":"5000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":1,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":7,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":11760,"capacityType":"solid"},"mass":"36.351","inertia":{"pitch":"12.69","yaw":"12.69","roll":"10.152"},"drag":{"forward":"4.461","reverse":"25.493","horizontal":"27.52","vertical":"27.52","pitch":"20.017","yaw":"20.017","roll":"20.017"},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"132528","average":"155915","max":"179302"},"production":{"time":"15","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"81"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"143"}]}},"manufacturer":"antigone"}
