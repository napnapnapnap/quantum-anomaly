Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"VA","variation":"Vanguard","type":"gunboat","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":12000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":4,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":40,"people":9,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":880,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":29.587,"inertia":{"pitch":5.723,"yaw":5.723,"roll":4.578},"drag":{"forward":5.443,"reverse":21.773,"horizontal":13.85,"vertical":13.85,"pitch":9.897,"yaw":9.897,"roll":9.897},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"637993","average":"750580","max":"863167"},"production":{"time":"24","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"134"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"708"}]}},"manufacturer":"argon"}
