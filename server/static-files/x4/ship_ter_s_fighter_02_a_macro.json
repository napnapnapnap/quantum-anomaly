  "description": "When the Pioneer Initiative set out to claim systems beyond the confines of Sol, they were supplied with Kukri-class fighters by the Terran military. Many of these ships, however, came with faulty components, as they were production units that had failed rigorous Terran acceptance testing. The brilliant minds among the Pioneer Initiative worked hard to address these flaws with the limited means available to them and, over time, modified the ships so much that they became almost unrecognisable.\\n\\nNow much more standardised, the Kalis-class fighter serves as a sturdier and more reliable Pioneer alternative to its Terran forerunner. The hostile environments in which the Segaris Pioneers operate require a heavily protected ship, so this unconventional design bridges the gap between standard and heavy fighters. It provides handling similar to the latter, due to its heavy shielding, while still being cheaper to produce for the struggling fledgling faction.",
