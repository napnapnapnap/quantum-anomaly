{"id":"ship_ter_m_frigate_01_a_macro","class":"ship_m","race":"ter","name":"Falx","basename":"Falx","description":"In the years since the Jump Gates realigned, this Protectorate-made support ship has become a cornerstone of the Terran fleets. The Falx is heavily inspired by the Argon Cerberus frigate, although the Terran engineers would never admit to that. Because it can carry a small-sized ship on board, it is often used for patrols. Should it encounter hostile forces, it can hold its own in combat until Terran reinforcements arrive, and on the distant fronts of the war against the Xenon it often acts as a reliable support ship.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"frigate","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":20000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":4,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":12,"missile":100,"people":23,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":1500,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":42.29,"inertia":{"pitch":4.412,"yaw":4.412,"roll":3.529},"drag":{"forward":25.165,"reverse":70.461,"horizontal":13.477,"vertical":13.477,"pitch":9.151,"yaw":9.151,"roll":9.151},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":1},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":6},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"2391781","average":"2813860","max":"3235939"},"production":{"time":37,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"67"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"207"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"94"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
