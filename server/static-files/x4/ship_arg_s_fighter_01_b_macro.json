  "description": "Though the prototype for the new-model Nova-class dogfighter was in development as far back as the Terran Conflict, it never reached mass-production before the Jump Gate shutdown. As such, its first major role was as an escort to Argon Federation exploratory groups that were sent out into newly discovered or rediscovered areas of space as the Jump Gates began to realign.\\n\\nIn terms of its class, the new-look Nova is a major step up in ship design, with rotatable engines that make it formidable in keeping up with and tracking targets of a similar size.",
