{"id":"ship_ter_s_scout_02_a_macro","class":"ship_s","race":"ter","name":"Nimcha","basename":"Nimcha","description":"The Nimcha was developed as a light and fast scout, capable of holding its own even outside heavily patrolled Terran Protectorate territory. It differs from other scout ships of similar size by having a noticeably larger cargo capacity. This means that, in the rare instances when the Protectorate requires a limited load to be delivered to a distant front quickly, the Nimcha can conveniently double as a courier, able to operate even when the destination is behind enemy lines.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"scout","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_s","hull":"3000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":1},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":2,"countermeasure":4,"deployable":50,"capacity":670,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":"7.872","inertia":{"pitch":"1.407","yaw":"1.407","roll":"1.125"},"drag":{"forward":"3.136","reverse":"6.498","horizontal":"4.031","vertical":"4.031","pitch":"3.866","yaw":"3.866","roll":"3.866"},"thrusters":{"size":"small"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"394163","average":"342750","max":"298043"},"production":{"time":"11","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"8"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"60"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"27"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
