{"id":"ship_ter_s_scout_02_a_macro","class":"ship_s","race":"ter","name":"Nimcha","basename":"Nimcha","description":"The Nimcha was developed as a light and fast scout, capable of holding its own even outside heavily patrolled Terran Protectorate territory. It differs from other scout ships of similar size by having a noticeably larger cargo capacity. This means that, in the rare instances when the Protectorate requires a limited load to be delivered to a distant front quickly, the Nimcha can conveniently double as a courier, able to operate even when the destination is behind enemy lines.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"scout","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_s","hull":3000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":1},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":2,"countermeasure":4,"deployable":50,"capacity":670,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":7.872,"inertia":{"pitch":1.407,"yaw":1.407,"roll":1.125},"drag":{"forward":3.136,"reverse":6.498,"horizontal":4.031,"vertical":4.031,"pitch":3.866,"yaw":3.866,"roll":3.866},"thrusters":{"size":"small"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"298043","average":"342750","max":"394163"},"production":{"time":11,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"8"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"60"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"27"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
