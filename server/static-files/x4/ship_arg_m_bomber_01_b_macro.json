Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"ST","variation":"Sentinel","type":"gunboat","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":14000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":4,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":40,"people":7,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":1056,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":35.505,"inertia":{"pitch":6.578,"yaw":6.578,"roll":5.263},"drag":{"forward":6.257,"reverse":25.028,"horizontal":16.62,"vertical":16.62,"pitch":11.376,"yaw":11.376,"roll":11.376},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"755166","average":"888430","max":"1021695"},"production":{"time":"29","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"159"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"838"}]}},"manufacturer":"antigone"}
