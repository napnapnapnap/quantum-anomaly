{"id":"ship_arg_m_bomber_02_a_macro","class":"ship_m","race":"arg","name":"Minotaur Raider","basename":"Minotaur","description":"A ship that saw much upheaval behind the scenes during the Terran Conflict, when it became painfully clear to the Argon that their ships were far inferior to the Terran equivalents, the Minotaur was over the course of the conflict completely redesigned as a mobile weapons-platform, sporting heavy weapons that deal incredible amounts of damage to similarly-sized and larger, slower targets. Unfortunately, the ship was unable to be put into mass-production before crisis crippled the Argon Federation, and as a result the new Minotaur has only recently entered service.","shortvariation":"RD","variation":"Raider","type":"scavenger","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_m","hull":13000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":2,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":15,"countermeasure":8,"deployable":100,"capacity":2370,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":26.629,"inertia":{"pitch":4.289,"yaw":4.289,"roll":3.431},"drag":{"forward":5.036,"reverse":20.146,"horizontal":12.465,"vertical":12.465,"pitch":8.241,"yaw":8.241,"roll":8.241},"thrusters":{"size":"medium"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"medium","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"medium","quantity":1},"specialExit":true,"price":{"min":"629863","average":"741015","max":"852167"},"production":{"time":"24","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"132"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"699"}]}},"manufacturer":"scaleplate"}
