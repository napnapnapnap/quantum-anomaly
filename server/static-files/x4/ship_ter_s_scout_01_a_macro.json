Along with these structural changes, several ship designs were drastically overhauled. The Rapier was redesigned to be lighter and faster, in order to cover more ground and improve the military's response time. These changes also resulted in the ship's somewhat unconventional, but still recognisable, new form.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"scout","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_s","hull":1400,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":1},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":2,"countermeasure":4,"deployable":50,"capacity":440,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":5.844,"inertia":{"pitch":1.213,"yaw":1.213,"roll":0.97},"drag":{"forward":1.182,"reverse":4.729,"horizontal":2.858,"vertical":2.858,"pitch":3.232,"yaw":3.232,"roll":3.232},"thrusters":{"size":"small"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"small","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"small","quantity":1},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"181730","average":"213800","max":"245870"},"production":{"time":"6","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"5"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"35"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"16"}]}},"manufacturer":"pioneers"}
