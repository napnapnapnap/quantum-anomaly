  "description": "This light freighter has a dark reputation. While verifiable facts are absent, pilots talk in hushed voices of an early Demeter outing. An apparently wealthy, yet eccentric and reclusive, Teladi mogul commissioned a freelance Demeter Captain to transport him and his cargo from Ianamus Zura to Argon Prime.\\n\\nRumour has it that the ship was subsequently found floating in space in the Silent Witness system. The Demeter was found with no Captain, crew, customer or cargo; no sign of attack or damage, and with completely cleared ship logs. No-one has heard from any of them since.\\n\\nThe Demeter remains popular with freighter captains untroubled by superstition. The Vanguard offers enhanced offensive capability for operations in more challenging sectors.",
