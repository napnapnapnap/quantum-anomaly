{"id":"ship_ter_xl_resupplier_01_a_macro","class":"ship_xl","race":"ter","name":"Honshu","basename":"Honshu","description":"This auxiliary ship, the Honshu(same as undefined), is noticeably slower than competitors' supply ships. While other ships of this type are usually aimed at providing immediate, short-term support for a fleet, this ship is designed to take part in long-distance operations that often lead Terran Protectorate fleets far away from Sol, and far also from allied harbours. For this reason, the design sacrifices speed for an exceptionally large storage capacity. However, this is not the only part of the ship that is engineered for long-range travel. Its most distinctive visual feature is its solar sail, which generates additional energy that can be made available to the ship's systems during extended journeys into hostile space.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":null,"type":"resupplier","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_xl","hull":"157000","shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":14,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":100,"missile":40,"people":123,"countermeasure":40,"deployable":450,"capacity":43000,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":"1199.838","inertia":{"pitch":"869.255","yaw":"869.255","roll":"695.404"},"drag":{"forward":"239.976","reverse":"959.903","horizontal":"431.671","vertical":"431.671","pitch":"939.968","yaw":"939.968","roll":"939.968"},"thrusters":{"size":"extralarge"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":10,"dock_s":40},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":1},"engines":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":1,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"22324290","average":"26263870","max":"30203451"},"production":{"time":"517","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"621"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"2859"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"1303"}]}},"manufacturer":"pioneers"}
