  "description": "The Dolphin transporter project largely built upon lessons learnt in prior developments, but also saw new innovations and subsystems designed by students and professors of the Royal Academy of Space Engineering. This cooperation proved to be fruitful for both Atreus Shipbuilding Currents, and for the students, who would gain professional experience and grow to become valuable engineers in the field, either by working directly for the company or founding their own. The Dolphin transporter was released in early 784 NT., Royal Academy of Space Engineering same as Royal Academy of Space Engineering\\n\\nAtreus Era ships were the first ships built in response to the beginning of the Jump Gate shutdowns of 778 NT. Fearing that systems might be cut off, they were designed to operate more autonomously in contrast to earlier ships which specialised in combined usage. To reduce flight mass, the ships are mostly filled with air, requiring Boron crew to wear protective suits. The Atreus Era ships are sturdier than the later Menelaus Era ships, but not as manoeuvrable.\\n\\nIn response to further Jump Gate shutdowns, the Queendom of Boron attempted to expedite the development of new ships through increased funding and the involvement of additional corporations and research facilities. Following the great success of their initial ship frame design for S-sized ships, Atreus Shipbuilding Currents was commissioned to spearhead all work on the M-sized follow-on projects, specifically the Dolphin transporter and Porpoise miner, but it outsourced some aspects of the work and associated research.",
