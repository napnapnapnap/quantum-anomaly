{"id":"ship_ter_s_heavyfighter_01_a_macro","class":"ship_s","race":"ter","name":"Gladius","basename":"Gladius","description":"With its distinctive sweeping wings, the Gladius was designed for medium to long distance travel, as well as engaging both small- and medium-sized ships in combat. These design criteria were carefully chosen, and the ship trades manoeuvrability for the ability to absorb more damage. The design focuses on allowing the ship to reach far-away pockets of the Jump Gate network, as part of the Terran Protectorate's new, more interventionist, policy in combating the Xenon.","shortvariation":"BV","variation":"Base Variation","type":"heavyfighter","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_s","hull":4400,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":4},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":null,"missile":20,"people":2,"countermeasure":4,"deployable":50,"capacity":360,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":9.477,"inertia":{"pitch":2.562,"yaw":2.562,"roll":2.05},"drag":{"forward":5.298,"reverse":21.715,"horizontal":3.426,"vertical":3.426,"pitch":3.899,"yaw":3.899,"roll":3.899},"thrusters":{"size":"small"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":0},"turrets":[],"weapons":[{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true},{"quantity":1,"size":"small","standard":true,"missile":true}],"shields":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"small","quantity":2},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"400180","average":"470800","max":"541420"},"production":{"time":"14","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,901}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"computronicsubstrate","amount":"11"},{"ware":"energycells","amount":"80"},{"ware":"metallicmicrolattice","amount":"36"}]}},"manufacturer":"terran"}
