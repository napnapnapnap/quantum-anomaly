{"id":"ship_arg_xl_resupplier_01_b_macro","class":"ship_xl","race":"arg","name":"Nomad Sentinel","basename":"Nomad","description":"Very quickly developed during the course of the latest defence against the Xenon, the Nomad is effectively a mobile equipment dock, allowing combat ships to repair and restock and get back to the fight more quickly. This has greatly helped the efficiency of both the Argon Federation and Antigone Republic fleets, and has already begun to see clones created across both Teladi and Paranid space.\\n\\nThe ship is not self-sufficient, requiring a defensive escort not to be torn apart in combat. If it can be defended though, the Nomad can prove a devastating support ship.","shortvariation":"ST","variation":"Sentinel","type":"resupplier","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_xl","hull":139000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":8,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":100,"missile":40,"people":183,"countermeasure":40,"deployable":450,"capacity":34800,"capacityType":"container"},"mass":1069.956,"inertia":{"pitch":628.114,"yaw":628.114,"roll":502.491},"drag":{"forward":293.991,"reverse":1175.965,"horizontal":560.905,"vertical":560.905,"pitch":913.991,"yaw":913.991,"roll":913.991},"thrusters":{"size":"extralarge"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":10,"dock_s":40},"turrets":[{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"extralarge","quantity":2,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":"8766199","average":"10313175","max":"11860151"},"production":{"time":"496","amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"2744"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"9659"}]}},"manufacturer":"antigone"}
