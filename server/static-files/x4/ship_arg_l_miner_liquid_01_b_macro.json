While a medium-sized ship had the advantage of moving quickly through mineral and gas regions, their cargo bays were simply not big enough for industrial-scale mining to be lucrative.\\n\\nNaturally, the Teladi stepped in to design L-sized resource collectors that could solve that problem, and the Magnetar is the Argon response to these ships; a standardised model that can be built in two variants, allowing it to support both asteroid mining and natural gas collection.","shortvariation":"ST","variation":"Sentinel","type":"largeminer","radarRange":"40000","docksize":"dock_l","hull":32000,"shield":{"max":0,"rate":0,"delay":0},"speed":{"forward":0,"acceleration":0,"boost":0,"travel":0,"pitch":0,"roll":0,"yaw":0},"armaments":{"weapons":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":0,"small":0},"turrets":{"extralarge":0,"large":0,"medium":6,"small":0}},"storage":{"unit":10,"missile":30,"people":38,"countermeasure":20,"deployable":250,"capacity":50400,"capacityType":"liquid"},"mass":246.324,"inertia":{"pitch":147.778,"yaw":147.778,"roll":118.223},"drag":{"forward":62.485,"reverse":357.059,"horizontal":151.999,"vertical":151.999,"pitch":155.677,"yaw":155.677,"roll":155.677},"thrusters":{"size":"large"},"shipstorage":{"dock_m":0,"dock_s":40},"dlc":"base","turrets":[{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":2,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":2,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},{"quantity":1,"size":"medium","standard":true,"missile":true,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}}],"weapons":[],"shields":{"size":"large","quantity":2},"engines":{"size":"large","quantity":2,"shields":{"quantity":1,"size":"medium"}},"specialExit":false,"price":{"min":1350914,"average":1589310,"max":1827707},"production":{"time":101,"amount":"1","method":"default","name":"{20206,101}","primary":{"ware":[{"ware":"energycells","amount":"560"},{"ware":"hullparts","amount":"1478"}]}},"manufacturer":"antigone"}
