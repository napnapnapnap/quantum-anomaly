      "30201022": "It is our task to push the physics of this universe to the breaking point and see if it answers any of those questions! My current employers only seem happy when my research results in novel weapon modifications. Very curious people, those Split.",
      "30201023": "I do hope they move me to a new tank soon. My tentacles grow weak.",
      "30201024": "You appear to be getting close to where I detected an anomaly.",
      "30201025": "I've uploaded new software to your ship systems.",
      "30201026": "Could you please try using the Long-Range Scanner to search for an anomaly in this vicinity.(for LRS name see {20108,1001} )",
      "30201027": "Ahha! There it is. If reports are to be believed, these anomalies are tears which may lead to other areas of space, much like the Jump Gates.",
      "30201028": "So, how adventurous do you feel today? Thanks to my research, I do have a fair idea of where you may end up. Of course, the quickest way to confirm my theory is to put it into practice!",
      "30201029": "Can you hear me? It took a moment to realign the frequency. It is just as I thought. You have made it through the anomaly and emerged in a distant region.",
      "30201030": "Your location is actually of great interest to me. Over the years, I have managed to pull sensor logs from passing ships to help further my work. I highlighted this as a prime location for my research, should I ever get the chance.",
      "30201031": "I'm sorry to interrupt, but it seems that you have arrived at a rather curious location.",
      "30201034": "I suggest you mark the location of the anomaly on your map.",
      "30201035": "Oh, it appears you have found another anomaly! How interesting.",
      "30201036": "Are you having trouble locating the anomaly in the area I have stated? I suggest you use the Long-Range scanner to help find it.",
      "30201037": "(having trouble getting through the anomaly)Hmm, it does seem quite tricky getting through the anomaly. It appears to require some speed to punch through.",
      "30201038": "(having trouble getting through the anomaly - joke)It looks like you're trying to enter an anomaly. Would you like help with that?",
      "30201039": "I don't mean to distract you from your business but do you intend to investigate that anomaly further? My fins are tingling in anticipation of the science we will achieve!",
      "30201040": "While the previous anomaly is interesting, my findings point to something else here which I expect will lead to a ground-breaking discovery. Allow me to guide you to a particular area.",
      "30201041": "I am currently evaluating what equipment we will need to make the most of this location.",
      "30201042": "Space here is wounded, with a scar in its fabric which seems to have healed multiple times. There is no record of any abnormal activity at these sites. To everyone else, this is simply an empty area of space.",
      "30201043": "In my search for signals from long-lost Boron I have detected multiple scars in space which continue to spew a multitude of particles and radiation. In a bustling sector such as this, it would only be seen as background noise. However, some of the noise seems to have artificial form.",
      "30201044": "We are going to tear this scar wide open and peer inside! Of course, the universe is a fickle thing. One miscalculation and we may well destroy this whole system. Ha! Such stakes make this all the more exciting!",
      "30201045": "Before we get started, allow me to reimburse you for your help so far. I do hope the Split don't mind me using their credit account to help fund our venture.",
      "30201046": "Now, the experiment. You will first need to place a satellite around this area in order for us to better understand its nature and how to best provoke the invisible anomaly.",
      "30201047": "I suggest you also deploy a resource probe so that we can see how the anomaly has affected the local environment. You should be able to acquire these deployable items from stations which offer upgrades.",
      "30201048": "I know of such a station near your location. I will add the information to your map.",
      "30201049": "It has been a great many years since I've had such a feeling of freedom. While the Split moved me to several locations as a part of my work, nothing quite beats going on a scientific expedition.",
      "30201050": "The placement must be precise.",
      "30201051": "Hmm, no. That satellite is not placed in a favorable position. You can collect it and redeploy if you wish.",
      "30201052": "Ah, good work. I am receiving a much clearer signal from the tear. Almost immediately, I can see that there are far more gravimetric shears here compared to any other anomaly ever documented. That indicates mass, but of what?",
      "30201053": "This shows some similarities with a Jump Gate event horizon but there is something else. Could it be a temporal distortion? Perhaps dimensional? Very interesting.",
      "30201054": "Would you please deploy a resource probe in the specified area, I am curious of this environment.",
      "30201055": "I see that you have already placed the resource probe in a suitable location. Very good.",
      "30201056": "You will now be able to see the yields of the resources in the area, should you wish to extract them. As for our research, it seems that nearby objects are covered in exotic particles, possibly spewed from the anomaly.",
      "30201057": "I hate to be a bother, but I have an idea on how to proceed.",
      "30201060": "Blowing up your only ship does not seem like a smart approach!(stammering voice of desperation)",
      "30201061": "I suggest you at least buy a second one, before you engage in a lengthy space walk that might exceed your oxygen supply.(hissing sounds of worry)",
      "30201062": "I have revealed the location of the nearest Wharf on your map!",
      "30201063": "You can interact with it and buy a ship remotely.",
      "30201067": "We will need a ship to be flown to a very precise location, near the anomaly. If we fit the ship with the right equipment, we may be able to open the tear wider and have a better idea of what is on the other side.",
      "30201068": "This will likely end up in the ship's destruction so I will help cover the expense of acquiring a new ship for the task.",
      "30201069": "Be sure that the ship is evacuated. It's far too early in this experiment for needless casualties.",
      "30201070": "The ship is in the correct position but is missing some of the required equipment. Please take a look at the details I have provided.",
      "30201071": "Very good. We seem to be ready for the initial test. I would advise that you clear the area as there are a number of unknowns.",
      "30201072": "The area must be clear of any obstacles!",
      "30201073": "(something goes wrong)Well then... I suppose we will have to try again.",
      "30201074": "I have successfully interfaced with the ship. I am increasing the output of the power-plant while reducing the shielding of the antimatter containers to see if that affects the anomaly.",
      "30201075": "Wonderful, we are getting a reaction! The ship is beginning to show strain but I will continue to push it further. Keep your distance.",
      "30201076": "The tear is expanding, it is about to reach the ship! The antimatter will most likely detonate!",
      "30201077": "Please check your mission briefing for the equipment the ship will need for the experiment.",
      "30201078": "(1/2)I have calculated that the ship will need to contain a small number of Antimatter Cells.(\"Antimatter Cells\" same as {20201,201})",

      "30201090": "What is this? Some large artificial structure? So, this is what was on the other side of the tear? It does seem that our investigation has lead to some potentially ground-breaking discovery!",
      "30201091": "Now my friend, this is where we must proceed with both haste and caution. While I admit, tearing through space-time with an antimatter explosion was far from restrained, we now have something in front of us of untold scientific value. We would be fools to continue carelessly.",
      "30201092": "For the benefit of the universe, let us hurry and claim our prize before someone can beat us to it! I'll be damned if some passing Teladi junk dealer decides to break it down for spare parts. Or worse yet, the Ministry of Finance Science Division.",
      "30201093": "I will begin to interface with the structure remotely. Do you mind flying around it so I can make some additional readings.",
      "30201094": "Let's start over here.",
      "30201095": "I'm marking a location of particular interest.",
      "30201096": "And now here.",
      "30201097": "These markings are not quite as 'alien' as I would have expected from such an object. Could this be a top-secret installation? Oh my. I do hope we haven't hijacked some distant Terran station.",
      "30201098": "It does seem somewhat unfinished, and the materials it is constructed from are quite strange. Even the computer pathways I am navigating are unconventional.",
      "30201099": "I cannot yet ascertain the function of this asteroid like mass in regards to the rest of the station. Given these readings, it may well be a power source. How interesting.",
      "30201100": "Ah, progress. It seems that this station is in an emergency state, possibly due to our actions. However, it appears that there is a backdoor protocol to resolve this. Give me a moment.",
      "30201101": "Wonderful! You see? The station is now under our control. I have access to much of its systems, although some are so alien I will need to take time to investigate them.",
      "30201102": "There appear to be connection points for additional station modules and they do seem to conform to our standards. If we wish to physically interface with the station without damaging it, I suggest constructing an area to land.",
      "30201103": "Oh, it appears I must go. My Split employers are approaching and they do sound agitated.",
      "30201104": "I will be in touch when I am able. As I have said, see if you are able to merge their technology with our own by building a dock.",
      "30201105": "Take care my friend.",
      "30201106": "(1/3)First, place a new dock module. You can put it wherever you desire.",

      "30201125": "I didn't expect I would need to enact this escape plan so abruptly.",
      "30201126": "Your help would be greatly appreciated. I will send instructions.",

      "30201130": "As you can see, I wish to escape the station via a chartered freighter.",
      "30201131": "There are actually multiple ships involved as to confound anyone wishing to track me.",

      "30201135": "I am successfully aboard my transport and en-route to the installation.",
      "30201136": "Oh, that didn't take long at all. It seems that my disappearance has been noticed.",
      "30201137": "I expect my ship is at a safe distance. I can't say the same for the others. Please be alert.",

      "30201146": "I expect I could spend years poring over the data contained in these systems.",
      "30201147": "I believe we will need help to run this station effectively. You could look to employ a manager.",

After an initial dispute over equitable distribution of real estate which was settled by the Federal Presidency, officially tying these entitlements to unalterable obligations as part of the colonisation process, the system saw a steady influx of settlers. However, just a few months later, the spotlight of attention shifted away from the once-promising colony. As more and more gates began to reopen, federal interest in The Reach rapidly dwindled, transforming it into the quiescent backwater system of today. To budding explorers and entrepreneurs, this new status carries with it a number of obvious benefits, most notably including an as yet comfortable distance to any military threats, which allows them to test their skills in a relatively forgiving environment. Moreover, the comparatively long period since its discovery has given the local aristocrats ample opportunity to build up a quasi-feudal power structure, turning the system into a slow and steady supplier for the local economy.",

Their immense wealth came with a considerable amount of political influence. As a result, the elites inhabiting the system managed to avoid conforming to regulations or paying taxes, while still maintaining good relations with, and easy access to, both neighbouring markets. Since these communities were incredibly wealthy, they could also afford to hire private security forces to keep piracy at bay. Gambling and other indulgences were commonplace, and the system developed an extensive leisure industry.\\n\\nWhen the connection between Windfall and its surrounding systems was severed, the community that had formed wanted for nothing. They had food and money aplenty, and while the resources in the system were not well suited for maintaining large scale industry, that was not an immediate concern. Cut off from any potential outside danger, they lived a life of luxury, and every station was a haven of arts and culture, clubs and casinos. Although these communities were now safe from outside threats, these luxury industries had generated a seedy underbelly that had long attracted all sorts of disreputable people, and an infection was festering from within. Isolated, with nothing but time and money on their hands, it was not long before rogue security forces, small time crooks, and racketeers of all sorts, fought over control of these stations and their markets. The most prominent of these organisations would eventually become the Vigor Syndicate(same as {20203, 3301}), which presided over Windfall's descent from an unregulated haven of the arts into a lawless, vicious place.",

At first they experimented with austere, spatially efficient housing complexes in the crevices of tethered asteroids. At some point, while deconstructing a freighter to attach its life-support systems to one of these asteroids, the ordained priest engineers found that they could modify its shield generator output, significantly lessening the protection from physical impact but at the same time greatly expanding the shield coverage; a discovery which they believed would consecrate their settlements against the metaphysical threats present in the system. Over the following two decades, more and more station complexes sprang up that used this adaptation of shield technology to facilitate the construction of large, specialised screen modules able to protect their habitation units.

Since the people living in Tidebreak could not venture far from their safe haven, the population lived in poverty and had to make do with scraps, and whatever resources they could gather in the intervals between Tides.\\n\\nFor a long time, Tidebreak was the only reliable shelter from the Tide's forces.

This substance, called Protectyon(Protectyon same as {20201,6701}), has unique properties that allow it to be used as fuel by the Riptide Rakers, to create protective shields powerful enough to withstand the intense stellar energy pulsing through Avarice. Thanks to this technology, the entirety of the Avarice system has since been reclaimed. In order to provide continuous protection, the new shield generators have to be regularly resupplied with small quantities of Protectyon, an incredibly rare and expensive substance. Stations which cannot afford to pay are left to fend for themselves and the people on these unprotected stations then fall victim to the Tide.

Its development was the Ministry's attempt at a cheap and technological solution to the Syndicate piracy problem introduced by the reconnection of Windfall to the Gate network. Developed in a department on Woodworm Scrubs, the Raven was the first ship to be suited for experimental cargo spoofing technology. Attempted scan readings present the cargo hold as filled with worthless wares, which should deter piracy attempts or make them less likely. While originally the Raven was required to develop this technology, it can now be applied more universally, and might protect ships not only from pirates, but also from police looking for illicit goods.(Courier same as {20221,2041}, Ministry of Finance Science Division as {10201,30201092}, Woodworm Scrubs same as {20102,2301}, Windfall same as {20005,9057})",

      "32611": "(Prometheus)The gradual Shutdown of the Jump Gates and the subsequent onset of the Dark shattered the shadowy organisation once known as the Duke's Buccaneers. Those that remained stalwart in their loyalty to the Pirate Duke had to rapidly adapt their operations to not be squashed under the heel of the newly emerging local authorities, or worse, fade into obscurity. Faced with the challenge to justify their further existence as an organisation, the majority of Buccaneer cells defaulted to the front they had already used for decades: the brutal, but dependable security outfit. Under this old and new guise, they acquired some renown transporting crucial personnel and wares for reconstruction and redevelopment. They also dealt in protection, corporate consulting, and other stunningly legal services. The support of well-equipped muscle proved useful for the leadership of the many societies that now struggled in isolation, and over the decades, the Buccaneers managed to refine their technology to suit the requirements of their new area of employment.\\n\\nThe Prometheus heavy transport is a relatively new addition to the arsenal of the Duke's Buccaneers, developed specifically to carry the lessons learned during the Dark into the era after the Realignment of the Jump Gates. Its hull is based on the Plutus, a well-known Paranid mining vessel. While earlier iterations of Buccaneer transport ships were often in fact civilian assets retrofitted for convenience, the design of the Prometheus is deliberate and insidious. Unless they were paying specific attention, any onlooker would simply see a mining ship, well-prepared for the dangers lurking at the edges of civilised space. On approach, such a hapless passerby or opportunistic brigand would soon realise that the inconspicuous hauler was in fact a well-armed pirate ship, perfectly equipped for a quick plunder. In one regard, the otherwise feigned identity as a deep space mining ship carries a sliver of truth, however: after a successful station raid, these ships tend to disappear towards the outskirts of a nearby sector, destination unknown.",

These design criteria were carefully chosen, and the ship trades manoeuvrability for the ability to absorb more damage.

Sleek in design, and distinguished from other fighters primarily by its speed, ships of this class are often dispatched to explore unfamiliar territory in which some enemy presence is expected. While useful for small-scale military action, the Takoba is not as adept at engaging the enemy head-on, as its shielding is somewhat weaker than the Terran fighters on which it was based.",

Many of these ships, however, came with faulty components, as they were production units that had failed rigorous Terran acceptance testing. The brilliant minds among the Pioneer Initiative worked hard to address these flaws with the limited means available to them and, over time, modified the ships so much that they became almost unrecognisable.\\n\\nNow much more standardised, the Kalis(same as {20101,62601})-class fighter serves as a sturdier and more reliable Pioneer alternative to its Terran forerunner. The hostile environments in which the Segaris Pioneers operate require a heavily protected ship, so this unconventional design bridges the gap between standard and heavy fighters.

While other ships of this type are usually aimed at providing immediate, short-term support for a fleet, this ship is designed to take part in long-distance operations that often lead Terran Protectorate fleets far away from Sol, and far also from allied harbours. For this reason, the design sacrifices speed for an exceptionally large storage capacity. However, this is not the only part of the ship that is engineered for long-range travel.

Despite the almost immediate collapse of the Avarice company, capable scientists and engineers soon took it upon themselves to stabilise the system and work towards sustainability. They first established a functioning wharf for repairs and replacement, and conducted early experiments into developing a recycling economy in anticipation of dwindling resources within the system. The regeneration of this post-shutdown economy was quickly curtailed by the first Tides, which destroyed most stations and ships in the system in 800 \\(NT\\). However, a side-effect of the destructive solar event was the greatly increased energy output from solar panels, which allowed for a paradigm shift. The new Rakers economy emerging from Tidebreak, at the time the only station in Avarice, took advantage of this new abundance of energy. This, along with the use of local wrecks, enabled the rebuilding of a new, sustainable, closed-loop economy based on recycling, allowing them to further improve on previous ship and station module designs. Resettlement of Avarice began in 818 \\(NT\\), when the Northriver Company introduced Protectyon and the associated Protectyon Shield Generators to safeguard stations from the Tide. A few years later, in 825 \\(NT\\), the reconnection of Windfall gave the long-isolated Rakers the opportunity to trade with various Syndicate factions, but also exposed them to their piracy.",

For nearly four decades, the inhabitants largely had to make do with an aging fleet of stranded ships that were taken by surprise by the Jump Gate shutdown. The few remaining engineers in the system were mainly occupied with maintenance, but experimented when they could with custom ship designs. They slowly learned the craft, and became creative with the resources they had to hand. Most of their custom creations were built from repurposed luxury mass traffic vehicles, spare engines disassembled from the leftover fleet, and various parts from scrapped ships that were beyond repair. It was only in 821 \\(NT\\), after the Jump Gate to Avarice opened, that a proper supply of resources allowed the engineers to finally abandon their custom creations and develop blueprints for mass production. Arguably, those blueprints still bear the hallmarks of the haphazard designs of the past.",

With a monopoly on food production and ice mining, it was imperative that they incorporated all capital ships in the system into their fleets, whether as working vessels or by scrapping them for parts. After the connection, they were the only faction in Windfall still capable of making full use of capital ships, and were unwavering in defending their mining rights against any newcomers.\\n\\nOnce the steady supply of resources from Avarice allowed the mass production of ships to restart, the Solid Ice Union began construction of a shipyard. At the same time, they started development of their own ice miner, the Donia. They drew on their experience with a broad range of ice miners, and their intricate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of now-dated Commonwealth designs.

The designers on board Aurora station had to make the ostentatious ship fulfil a large number of extravagant and often conflicting requirements set by their client. As such, both the assembly of the pompous final product and the manufacturing of many of its core components had to happen by hand, and the Astrid therefore remains a prized unicum. A wide array of highly specialised workshops and laboratories had to be commissioned to provide the garish synthetic materials and dazzling, custom-made metalwork used in its lavish interior and uniquely refracting, streamlined hull. This entire process proved to be incredibly expensive, and the Astrid is therefore deemed utterly unsuitable for mass production, much to the delight of the affluent collector. While working on its engine, the Aurora engineers heavily leaned on their previous experience with designing high speed ships like the Lux. The dazzlingly flamboyant ship also carries a thickly shielded storage compartment capable of containing volatile Bose-Einstein Condensates, rumoured to somehow improve its resistance to cosmic particles and improve its flight characteristics. Though this claim may sound like pseudo-scientific marketing lingo, one has to agree that even for a grandiosely cutting-edge yacht, the Astrid turns out to be surprisingly fast, which has given CEO of the Northriver Company the reputation to be in multiple places at once if he so pleases.",

This project was an attempt at building a capital ship, sturdy enough to withstand the Tide and be used as a mobile base in Avarice. No sooner had they succeeded in providing the ship with sufficient shielding, than they abandoned all work on the barely operational Erlking. They refocused their attention on another, undisclosed, major project, before ultimately disappearing. Despite being unfinished, the Erlking continued to be deployed, while Tidebreak engineers repeatedly attempted, and failed, to improve on, or even reproduce, the design's unique power core.\\n\\nWith the connection of Avarice to the more militarised Syndicate system in 821 \\(NT\\), Tidebreak engineers attempted to weaponise the Erlking, and reclassified it as Battleship. They added turret and weapon hard-points, but failed to develop compatible turrets and weapons. The Syndicate later confiscated the ship to remove this potential military threat, and attempted to develop the weapon systems themselves. Among the engineers of Windfall, those of the Solid Ice Union had the most experience with capital ships, but the political situation, and fear of a power grab, meant that they were not allowed to work on the Erlking. Instead, the Scrapyard engineers were tasked with completing the weapon systems. Having previously failed to stabilise the energy supply on the Shih fighter, to increase the number of supported weapons, the Erlking presented them with the opposite problem: all efforts to connect conventional weaponry to its unique power grid resulted in them being blown off the hull. Attempts to modify either the power grid or the weapon systems were also in vain, but their work had started only recently and Syndicate expectations remained high.(Battleship same as {20221,5031}, Sihi Do is female)",

      "102": "Originally installed by the Plutarch Mining Corporation, the so called Badlands Colony, not actually a colony but a mining operation, was however repurposed after the Albion gate powered down and as since served as an actual colony and stronghold to PMC senior staff. The fragment of the Broken Moon the station was built into had supposedly been chosen due to a large tunnel leading all the way from one side of the rock to the other allowing easy access to its interior through many shafts driven into its walls. One part of the installation still serves as a mining facility and is commonly referred to as The Mines.",
      "201": "Lonely Giant",
      "202": "Probably a candidate for the title of Profiteroid 2.0 the Lonely Giant brims with a strange concentration of 99% pure Hydrogen-3 in crystalline form. The visible crystals on the surface only amount for a tiny fraction of what deep scans have revealed to be immense chasms on the inside filled up with frozen Hydrogen-3. However, both the reason why the Lonely giant did not yet melt under the heat of Albion's central star nor willingly spread its wealth is the immensely hard silicate a majority of the rock is made up from, giving the PMC a hard time twisting its innards. For the meantime the two massive rocks orbiting one another are held in a containment field trapping the subliming Hydrogen-3 gas emanating from the surface crystals with the pretty side-effect of illuminating the whole scene in a soothing picturesque turquoise as the gas touches the particle barrier.",
      "301": "Core Dig",
      "302": "The Core Dig was the most prominent source for the Iridium isotope Ir-209, also known as the famous 'Unobtainium'. This is a stable and highly heat-resistant anti-ferromagnetic complex agent perfectly suited for fusion reaction containment. Such containment suffered from the previous lack of a material that was not also radio-activated under constant neutron radiation. Iridium-209, formerly considered non-existent in nature and ineffective through cost to synthesise, seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, as Matter/Antimatter technology emerged and increased its hold on the reactor market, Unobtainium faced a severe decline in demand and resale value compared to the cost of extraction and processing. The Core Dig now operates with a reduced crew and has redirected its operations to extract and store the trace Nividium also present in the minerals available.",
      "401": "Lost Colony",
      "402": "The crude technology this large installation is based on still bears a glimpse of genius. Its core consists of a series of tunnel connections between some junction structures of different sizes upon which the surrounding gases were made to condense and crystallize under the influence of a chemical catalyst. Today the station has a crystalline coating of varying thickness between 100 and 500 Metres and will most likely form a solid asteroid-like mega-crystal a couple hundred years from now. The Lost Colony already has pioneers dig into the thicker areas of the coating expanding the station into it with some success now which makes it clear that this colony may very well grow into something far more befitting of such name.",
      "601": "The Aqueduct",
      "602": "As the M/AM drives gained popularity this behemoth among freshwater supply stations was quickly abandoned in favour of more readily accessible water sources. Before that however the Aqueduct was the Maelstrom system's largest freshwater supply installation and probably one of the largest facilities of its kind in the known universe. Today it is being swarmed by Xenon who lurk within the dense clouds of frozen H2O that span the space between the many asteroids around the Sable Vortex.",
      "701": "The Maze",
      "702": "Named for the countless natural and artificial tunnels that snake through it, the Maze is the huge broken asteroid in which the Jump Gate in Fields of Opportunity is situated. The nature of the tunnels, which run from one end of the asteroid to the other, lead the Teladi to believe that the Maze was broken up for mining by one of the system's previous occupants, though there is no evidence to suggest who these settlers may have been.",
      "801": "Overwatch",
      "802": "Though Overwatch still receives a supply of Teladianium from the foundries in Fields of Opportunity, after a Jump Gate realignment the Habitat-class \"superstation\" was cut off from most of the technology it requires to manufacture ships from its dedicated shipyard. Even though it now depends on Albion for these technologies, Overwatch still has much to offer the system, since it provides food and energy to all the stations still scattered across Serpentine Haze and Fatal Path. More importantly, however, it is home to thousands of Teladi civilians and the headquarters of the Teladi Union, making it the first port of call for any traveller coming to Fields of Opportunity.",
      "901": "War Memorial",
      "902": "The Teladi of Fields of Opportunity have always struggled against the Xenon that exist on the outskirts of the system, but mass incursions into the system by the Xenon are rare. When they have occurred, however, they have always ended in bloodshed. The so-called \"War Memorial\" is perhaps the largest of the battle scars, and was left in the far north of Serpentine Haze in commemoration of the Teladi who sacrificed themselves to make sure their comrades would escape unharmed.\\n\\nRealising that they did not have the firepower to push the Xenon back, three Teladi captains ordered their crews to abandon ship before ramming the Branch 9 Xenon K leading the attack and causing it to crash into the side of an asteroid. The subsequent explosion destroyed everything in the vicinity, but ended what had been one of the Teladi's most vicious and bloody conflicts.",

      "2302": "The Torus Aeternal was an orbital ring station encircling and guarding planet Earth until the advent of the Second Terraformer War. The structure's scale and capabilities were unprecedented within the Jump Gate network. Tethers kept the station in a stable orbit and allowed for the transportation of people and wares between the station and the planet. While the outward-facing sections were completed, many of the sections facing Earth were still under construction. This limited the number of people present on the Torus Aeternal to an estimated 1 million.\\n\\nThe Torus Aeternal was ultimately destroyed during the Second Terraformer War. Two Argon infiltrators, Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu, initiated an emergency procedure known as segment-separation, during which the station separated into its 420 constituent segments and drifted into higher orbit, irrevocably destroying the Torus. This destruction of the Torus triggered all out war with the Argon Federation(same as {20203,201}).",

Had it not been for the heroic actions of the Dragonfly, drawing the Terraformers through this Gate before its destruction, Earth and all humans in Sol would have succumbed to the machines. The resulting 500 years of isolation, knowing what lies beyond and yet confined to this small corner of the galaxy, were considered a small price to pay for the survival of Earth.",
      "2501": "(Terran Jump Gate)",
      "2502": "After the rediscovery of the lost colony of Aldrin, the former United Space Command decided to establish a lasting Jump Gate connection. The commissioned Jump Gate would be the third Gate created by Terran engineering. Neptune was chosen as the location for the new Jump Gate, its distance to Earth being a compromise; close enough for trade, but far enough not to become a major safety risk. The connection served people from both sides, allowing for economic, scientific and cultural exchange after centuries of separation. Like the rest of the gate network, this connection was lost during the Jump Gate shutdown.\\n\\nEven with the Second Terraformer War on hold and the Jump Gate shutdown in progress, Terran relations with the Community of Planets were still poor at best. This led the Terran High Command to set up a covert operation to re-establish a connection using the Neptune Gate. The Terrans chose to connect the Gate to an old Gate in the Brennan's Triumph system, originally destroyed during the First Terraformer War. After moving the alien Jump Gate to the far outskirts of Brennan's Triumph and repairing it, the Terrans managed to establish a connection and keep it secret for several years. After the Jump Gate in the Asteroid Belt shut down, the Neptune Gate prevented Sol from being fully disconnected from the Gate network once again. With the help of an independent entrepreneur, the Terrans connected the outskirts of Brennan's Triumph with its core, establishing their hegemony over the system.",

Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and lasertowers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\\n\\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst. This lowers the efficiency of the heat dissipation between bursts and thereby exponentially drives up the cost of the internal shielding, but results in an overall higher damage output.",

It is often considered the logical next step after having familiarised oneself with the Pulse Laser. Its prolonged bursts can easily tear apart targets of a similar size, but the projectiles are larger and move at a slower pace than Pulse Laser particles. This means that the pilot needs to have experience in gauging when to expend their burst, and when to let the weapon cool down and wait for a better opportunity. When facing off against this weapon, nimble ships may be able to dodge its stream of bullets by strafing and making spiral movements. Against capital ships, the Bolt Repeater is a suitable choice for destroying surface elements such as turrets and shields, though it struggles to leave a lasting impact on the ship's hull.\\n\\nThe modern-day Bolt Repeater is the result of a development path taken by Argon military scientists from old Mass Driver designs; a weapon which first saw use during the era of the Kha'ak threat. By stripping out the original weapon's ability to penetrate shields, and instead maximising the force of its continuous bullet output, they created a robust all-rounder that was soon adopted by the Federation's allies because of its sheer brutal efficiency.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant uses even larger projectiles while maintaining the same projectile speed, resulting in a lower rate of fire but an increased level of overall trauma to the target's hull and shields.",

When it comes to its damage output, the Shard Battery has been compared to the Plasma Cannon, but it offers a slightly different range of applications. Skilled military pilots may occasionally make use of this weapon against small targets in an attempt to end the fight quickly, but it is generally agreed upon that one should try to avoid these situations. The Shard Battery reaches its fullest potential against larger and slower targets such as M-sized ships, which cannot as easily evade its projectiles. It is also especially effective against capital ship surface elements, provided that the pilot can find an opportunity to target them from the blind spots of nearby turrets.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant fires fewer shards at a higher speed but with a shorter interval. This raises the overall damage output and improves the weapon's accuracy, especially against more nimble targets, but in turn incurs a quicker heat build-up.",

They adjusted it for Terran high-energy mount compatibility, effectively increasing its power, while also preventing the Commonwealth from using it.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant increases the damage output, despite reducing the rate of fire, by making the individual projectiles more powerful still.",

It dispenses with the use of clips for short bursts, and puts a greater emphasis on the power of the individual projectiles. Despite the weapon's reduced effective range, the microscopic particles are accelerated faster and reach their targets much quicker. Heat therefore accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight. The Terran Pulse Laser can only be attached to a high-energy weapon mount; a requirement that is common for Terran specialist weapons.\\n\\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time: the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering. The result still behaves like a Pulse Laser in practice, but has become virtually unusable by foreign powers.\\n\\nThe Mk2 variant greatly improves the weapon's energy output and rate of fire, while only marginally raising its rate of heat accumulation.",

      "9022": "The Scrap Tractor employs an array of graviton beams to leash an object to a towing ship. The beams automatically and independently adjust their focus to further enhance the gravitational forces as the distance between the two objects becomes greater, resulting in an elasticity effect. All resistance is not futile, however, since severe disruptions, such as being hit by weapon fire, will cause the connection to break. Likewise, the graviton beams are inherently unstable until the artificial gravitational field is fully engaged, and even minor distortions such as the lingering effects of depleted shields, or electrical currents behind the target's hull, will prompt them to lose focus. Because of these limitations, the Scrap Tractor is mainly used to tow ship wrecks below a certain size limit, to avoid exceeding the maximum energy output of the weapon mount. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the connection remains stable during Jump Gate traversals.\\n\\nThe modern Scrap Tractor has only recently been made available to the wider Gate Network by the Alliance of the Word. The Alliance received the designs for it by deep space messenger drone, sent from the Avarice system, which was once thought lost. It is, however, by no means an entirely new technology. Before the Terran Conflict, and even up until the Gate Shutdown, a predecessor of this weapon - or rather tool - was occasionally deployed by opportunistic scavengers, looking to profit from the ongoing destruction of advanced warships in conflict zones. However, due to the general abundance of resources in the well-connected Gate Network at the time, and the inherent danger of the profession, it never saw widespread use, and the factories necessary for its production were often dismantled as quickly as they sprung up.",

Over distance, however, the damage output falls off steeply, and at maximum range barely matches that of a standard L Pulse Laser turret. Although the Erlking is perfectly capable of defending itself at a distance, the high damage output of its turrets at short range makes it much more dangerous at close proximity, meaning that aggressive manoeuvres by the Erlking's pilot are rewarded. This exceptional performance is attributed to the Erlking's power core, from which the turrets draw energy.\\n\\nBoso Ta commented that this turret employs electronic redundancies designed to be especially robust against internal radiation damage, and that this is necessary due to its slight but continuous exposure to the power core.

Whereas field coils for shields and antimatter converters for engines are more modular and can be used 'across the board', different weapons and turrets expect different electronic systems to be used in order to ensure the correct properties. However, as all equipment is built and repaired on demand, all advanced electronics are shipped to shipyards and equipment docks together.",

During the Terran Conflict, which forcefully distracted the Paranid Pontifex's attention, Duke's Haven(same as {20103,1401}) was established as the faction headquarters in a newly discovered border system. That system was later grandiosely renamed Lasting Vengeance(same as {20005,9001}), presumably in honour of one of the Duke's driving motivations in the subsequent escalation.\\n\\nThe Duke's Buccaneers were infamous for requiring absolute commitment from their members, demanding that they cut all former ties, and sending them on dangerous infiltration and assassination missions against their former affiliates to prove their allegiance. For most of the faction's supporters, this made maintaining good standings with major political powers, or even pirate organisations, nigh on impossible, and over time resulting in them serving only the Buccaneers. Eventually, political tensions rose and the Buccaneers became hunted by their Paranid neighbours, leading to attacks on their headquarters itself. Regardless of the meticulous planning and seeming precision of those strikes, they never managed to corner or kill the pirate leader himself. The Duke always seemed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, all the while giving his loyal subjects ample opportunity to make a profit in the ensuing chaos.\\n\\nAccording to the sparse pre-shutdown records, during a wave of warp instabilities between 780 and 782 NT, the Pirate Duke was on the verge of achieving his grandest scheme yet, when suddenly, the Buccaneers headquarters in Lasting Vengeance, and with it a large part of the admiralty, was cut off from the rest of the network. The faction as a whole, like many others at the time, dispersed quickly, with only a handful of small pirate bands continuing to vie for control of the now-isolated systems of the New Duchy. After the realignment of the Jump Gates, the Buccaneers were at first thought extinct. Though there were occasional supposed sightings in Paranid territory, these reports weren't given much attention, especially considering the much more pressing issue of the Paranid Civil War.",

Together with a notorious political analyst and a hired special operative, she sabotaged the peace negotiations at their most crucial moment, turning the faction representatives against one another, manipulating her Pirate Duke into returning to his warlike former self and abandoning his foolish notions of peace for good. In the wake of this diplomatic disaster, military economies across the network received a welcome boost, as the newly forged Duke's Tempest plunged the Paranid systems into a three-way holy war. Despite the strategy of careful schemes layered on top of political intrigue and piratical destabilisation that led to its formation, this faction cares little about collateral damage and only aims to rip all of Paranid territory from the unjust rule of the weak and unworthy Pontifices.",

      "2602": "As peace negotiations between the Godrealm of the Paranid(same as {20203,401}) and the Holy Order of the Pontifex(same as {20203,501}) began in earnest, the numbers flocking to the Holy Order Faithful(same as {20203,2601}) rose quickly to threatening levels. Driven by an absolute commitment to the True Pontifex and backed by high-ranking officials, this not-so-secret organisation regularly mobilises elite pilots and saboteurs, against ally and enemy alike, to stop any semblance of diplomacy between the Paranid factions dead in its tracks. According to their official propaganda, they pursue a conviction which is shared by a significant proportion of the Paranid populace: that the Paranid Civil War(same as {30220,205}) - originating from the fundamental geometric imperfection of the duality of Pontifices - can only truly be resolved through the utter annihilation of the opposing faith. It has, however, been theorised that something far less spiritual lies at the heart of their strategic outlook on the schism. Over the course of the last decade, entire economies have become reliant on the extraordinary military spending fuelled by this conflict, so it comes as no surprise that whenever the Faithful appear to be defeated, they're able to rapidly rebuild their forces with the support of anonymous donors from across the Jump Gate network.",

      "2802": "The Yaki were an infamous organised crime syndicate operating mostly in Argon space, turning a profit by raiding traders and deliberately inciting chaos from which they then could benefit. They were well known for their professional and precise mode of operation, choosing their targets carefully and acting swiftly before any reinforcements could arrive. One branch of the Yaki Syndicate who were especially notorious were the Beryll, specialising in the theft and trade of advanced technologies. Their focus on near-AGI technology would inevitably put them at odds with the Terran government.\\n\\nDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, things quietened down considerably. Over time, Yaki raids became a less common occurrence. It appeared that different clans were splintering off and disappearing into obscurity. Even after the gate network was re-established, the Yaki were not as significant a presence as before.\\n\\nIt is now quite rare to spot Yaki ships. To the Community of Planets, it is currently unclear whether the Yaki have a fixed base hidden away somewhere, or whether their remnants are purely nomadic people, as they seem to disappear without a trace after what few raids they do still conduct. In fact, it is not even clear whether there is a coordinated Yaki organisation at all, any more, as their ships have been observed displaying wildly varying and erratic behaviours. All attempts at re-establishing official contact have failed, and on the scant occasions when a pilot has actually managed to communicate with a Yaki, the Yaki pilots' behaviour could only be described as bizarre and their ramblings incoherent. It remains to be seen whether the Yaki pose a real threat to the law-abiding citizens of the network, or whether, in their current state, they are a mere shadow of their former selves.",

      "2902": "When the Jump Gates started to shut down, many disparate groups from all across the network were stranded in the Sol system. The Terran government was wary of these refugee communities suddenly forming in their midst. In order to keep them away from Sol's inner core, and make the best of a difficult situation, the Terran government brought the Pioneer Initiative into being. With the stated aim of exploring and settling the furthest outskirts of Sol, they then rallied the displaced groups under its banner. When a Gate connection was restored, and Neptune(same as {20004,1100011}) was suddenly adjacent to several unclaimed systems, the Terran government encouraged the Pioneer Initiative to venture out of Sol and explore and settle this new-found space.\\n\\nDelighted to now have a home of their own, the Pioneer Initiative, upon re-discovering the Segaris(same as {20003, 1130011}) system, welcomed more and more disparate groups into their fold and distanced themselves from their Terran origin by changing their name to Segaris Pioneers(same as {20203,2901}). Their effort to gain true independence is a work in progress, however. It is a delicate balancing act, as they are still heavily reliant on the Terran government for protection and economic support. Their hope and belief is that the best way out of this disadvantageous situation, is to throw themselves into seeking scientific advancements that can one day lead to them to true independence.",

The restructuring of these responsibilities came about following the USC's failure to prevent the destruction of the Torus Aeternal by foreign saboteurs; an incident which scarred the Terran population and threw the government's ability to protect Sol into question.\\n\\nDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran government seized the opportunity to reassure their citizens. Separated from the network, their economy thrived and the Terran Protectorate fortified their presence in Sol. Critics of the Terran government have claimed that establishing the Protectorate was merely an attempt to re-brand the USC, and that the underlying structural problems remained. However, there is no disputing that the Terran Protectorate does now operate differently from its predecessors. Not only is the Protectorate extremely zealous in its defence of the inner core of Sol, to the point where not even all Terran citizens are allowed to approach Earth, but they are also heavily involved in Sol's external relations. Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network. Fleets are regularly sent out to ensure that Xenon pockets are eradicated, without regard for the sovereignty of the space in question. Nor do they shy away from actively trying to meddle in other governments' affairs in order to influence their stance on AGI technology. Their preoccupation with destroying the Xenon at all costs frequently puts them at odds with the Community of Planets.",

Their way of life has been forged by the hostile environments of the Avarice system(Avarice same as {20005,9033}). Largely disorganised, and without any military capabilities, they do not pose a threat to any of the other inhabitants of the Jump Gate network; nor would they want to, since they are entirely focused on their own survival.\\n\\nBeing extremely resourceful, the Riptide Rakers have specialised in scrapping wrecked ships and other space debris commonly found in and around Avarice. Ingeniously making use of the exceptional stellar properties of Avarice, they are uniquely capable of maintaining an economy almost entirely focussed on recycling and reusing materials. Since they are generally on good terms with the other groups inhabiting the network, they have taken to dismantling wrecks and trading their recycled materials on a larger scale, ever since their gate re-established a connection.\\n\\nTheir resourcefulness and resilience is only matched by their stubbornness. Despite regularly suffering from the impact of the Tide, they stoically continue to live under the hazardous circumstances that make their large scale operations possible. In recent years they have found ways to shelter from the most devastating effects of the phenomenon, but stranded ships and the occasional station are still tragically annihilated. Many inhabitants of the network wonder why the Riptide Rakers would expose themselves to these dangers, but if you asked a Riptide Raker, the answer would be quite simple. They have become numb to the dangers of Avarice. It is their way of life, they will tell you, and they really just have nowhere else to go.",

They quarrelled amongst themselves almost as much as they antagonised outsiders and the common citizens of Windfall. These smaller outfits mostly made money by offering security services to the large, wealthy gambling institutions, by running their own high-stakes games, and by manufacturing and trading illicit substances. The time spent in isolation was chaotic and violent, but the absence of any organised law enforcement also provided ample opportunities to get incredibly rich with comparatively little effort. Maintaining that wealth amid all the other cut-throats was the bigger challenge, and the reason why these smaller groups eventually banded together.\\n\\nThe Vigor Syndicate was not the only semi-organised criminal enterprise to arise out of this unstable but prolific environment, but ultimately it would be the one to assert itself. Its power and influence grew when contact with the people of Avarice was established. With no-one to oppose them, they soon began to exploit the Riptide Rakers(same as {20203, 3201}) by offering them predatory loans, and methodically nurturing industrial dependencies among their destitute neighbours.\\n\\nNow, although there still is no clearly identifiable leadership and back-stabbings are still a regular occurrence, the organisation has grown to such a size that it has stabilised and effectively presents a united front to the outside. With Windfall now connected to both Argon and Teladi space, the Syndicate has fully consolidated in order to project enough power to keep other organisations out of Windfall. They keep the law away, and offer unscrupulous entities the space in which to grow however they see fit; as long as the Vigor Syndicate gets their cut, of course.",

      "1001": "Arrival of USC X and Kyle Brennan",
      "1002": "No one would have imagined that at the peak of Xenon activity in the Community of Planets, in 742 NT, a ship from Earth would arrive in Seizewell, a star system controlled by the Teladi Company, using a functioning jump drive.\\n\\nThough there was much ado about the Terran pilot and his extraordinary ship, Kyle William Brennan quickly proved his mettle by volunteering to aid in the Second Xenon Conflict, using the Terran technology equipped on the USC X, which far outstripped anything available in the Community of Planets, to cripple the Xenon central supply and power facilities. For his feat, Brennan was named \"The Hero of the Xenon Conflict\".",
      "1011": "A New Threat Emerges",
      "1012": "Years after Kyle Brennan's heroism, his son through Ninu Gardna was arrested for ties to the Yaki Syndicate. Though Julian Gardna-Brennan chose rehabilitation over imprisonment, his chance for true redemption came weeks later as the Argon colony of President's End was laid to waste by a fleet of unknown alien spaceships, later named the Kha'ak after a Split folk-tale.\\n\\nThe Kha'ak were relentless in their assaults, striking all across the Jump Gate network. The offensive could only be stopped by Julian and his close friends, Saya Kho and Brett Serra, who chased the Kha'ak to Omicron Lyrae, where they were using Julian's father to unwillingly control an M0-class battleship.\\n\\nJulian was able to rescue his father, and halt the Kha'ak assault on the system, but only at the cost of Brett Serra's life.",
      "1021": "The Race To Find Earth",
      "1022": "After the Battle of Omicron Lyrae, Kyle Brennan's desperate search for Earth became a staple of public opinion for many months. There were even those who believed his story and followed in his footsteps. These few included Ion, a Goner, who asked Julian Brennan for his assistance in claiming Kha'ak technology to build a new Jump Gate to Earth.\\n\\nWith the task completed, Kyle - still with an active connection to the Kha'ak hive - accidentally lead the Kha'ak directly to the Gate, and then to Earth itself. If the Kha'ak expected a swift victory in Sol, however, they were denied it, as the far superior USC fleet, greatly improved since their disconnect from the Jump Gate network, awaited them.",
      "1031": "First Contact with the Paranid",
      "1032": "In the wake of the Terraformer Conflict that had seen the Argon separated from their Terran roots, paranoia was so rife among them that peaceful negotiation between them and the first alien species they encountered was difficult to induce.\\n\\nFirst identified by the Argon as Xenomorphs, then as Xenon \\(before the word was irrevocably connected with the descendants of the Terraformer fleet\\), tentative diplomatic talks with the Paranid began in 130 NT, after years of small skirmishes wherein both races had refused to identify themselves.\\n\\nProgress was slow, with neither race trusting the other, but eventually trade and information exchanges were negotiated that benefited the Argon and Paranid both technologically and culturally.",
      "1041": "Foundation of the Federation",
      "1042": "Building themselves up from nothing after facing complete annihilation by the Terraformers in the Terraformer Conflict, the Argon spread throughout the Jump Gate network at a far slower rate than the original Terran settlers.\\n\\nDuring this time, there were of course many disagreements over the direction of the Argon people, leading to the secession of both the Hatikvah Free League \\(original\\) and Free State of Solara from Argon Prime leadership. Despite their differences, however, they were able to join in an alliance, and in 241 NT the covenant creating the Argon Federation, with Argon Prime as its capital, was signed.",
      "1051": "First Contact with the Boron",
      "1052": "It was nearly two hundred years after first contact between the Argon and Paranid, in 323 NT, that first contact with the Queendom of Boron was made. The Boron were very open to treaty negotiations, and it was a mere four months after first contact that trade and cultural accords were signed between Argon Prime and Kingdom End, the Boron home system. These accords formed a strong basis for Argon-Boron relations that have lasted ever since; the foundation upon which a close friendship between the two races was built.\\n\\nThe Paranid, less trusting than the Argon, refused to sign treaties so quickly with a race with whom they had had so little contact.",
      "1061": "The Boron Campaign",
      "1062": "The peace that all three of the Argon, Paranid and Boron had known for a year after the Argon-Boron treaties were signed was suddenly shattered when the Queendom was attacked by a fleet of unknown ships accompanied by a flotilla of Paranid ships. The Boron were only able to survive the conflict with the help of the Argon, who were furious with the Paranid because of their sudden aggression.\\n\\nThe Split, to whom the ships of unknown design had belonged, quickly made themselves known as an aggressive and war-hungry people who wished to challenge themselves against all, and for a number of years, small skirmishes with the Split were known to occur both in Boron and Argon space.",
      "1071": "The Community of Planets",
      "1072": "In an effort to avoid further violence between the Argon, Boron, Paranid and Split, the Community of Planets was founded in 328 NT, pledging to work together in all things and against all threats in unity. Attempts were at first unsuccessful, with only the Argon and the Boron joining the Community in a so-named \"Guild of Founders\". The Paranid and Split, respective relations with the Argon and Boron still in ruin, refused to join, instead making their own alliance.",
      "1081": "200 Years of Cold War",
      "1082": "Following the initial and somewhat failed founding of the Community of Planets, there were years of cold war between the Argon and the Boron, and the Paranid and the Split. Though all races saw moderate economic growth and technological achievement, it was fuelled predominantly by the necessity to be ready for war.\\n\\nThis cold-war state was finally broken in 489 NT when the Paranid, after much long and difficult diplomacy, agreed to join the Community of Planets. Though for another twenty-five years the Split Patriarchy stubbornly believed they could stand alone, they too were brought into the fold, in 514 NT, when the second formal founding of the Community of Planets was completed.",
      "1091": "First Contact with the Teladi",
      "1092": "Contact with another species calling itself the Teladi was made in 550 NT. Ostensibly searching for their lost home, Ianamus Zura, the newcomers proved themselves shrewd business people with the uncanny ability to make the best of even the worst situation. Their introverted nature and ubiquitous tendency towards avarice proved uncomfortable to other races, but their financial brilliance all but assured them a place within the Community of Planets.\\n\\nSuch was their dominance over other races in business and economic fields that the Teladi quickly became the primary financial power within the Community, even introducing the Credit as a Community-wide currency to great success.",
      "1101": "The Terraformer Project Begins",
      "1102": "In the wake of the USCSS Winterblossom's discovery of an entirely empty, alien Jump Gate network, there were immediate and numerous calls for a colonisation programme.\\n\\nWhile rendering planets suitable for human habitation was possible with then modern Terran technology, it was still slow and arduous. Instead of sending human crews out for decades to complete this task, fleets of intelligent robot vessels, Terraformers, were designed and built to complete it with speed, efficiency and far less risk.\\n\\nOver the course of thirty years from 2066 AD, the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets were sent out into the network to terraform a dozen planets inside their stars' biospheres.",
      "1111": "The Terraformer Conflict",
      "1112": "In 2145 \\(-25 NT\\), fleets of mutated, long-forgotten Terraformer ships, thought destroyed by the safe self-destruct command issued forty-six years prior, appeared in orbit around Earth, their terraforming tools turned into weapons of war as billions died in the ensuing firefight around Sol. The USC was caught unprepared, with few ships and minimal crews on each. The war put all previous conflicts to shade.\\n\\nIn 2146, the crew of the USCSS Dragonfyre, Nathan Ridley Gunne, Poul Vantera and Frank de Vries, lured the Terraformer away from Earth, through a Jump Gate connected to the larger, alien network stumbled upon by the USCSS Winterblossom. As the Terraformer fleet followed the USC fleet away, Gunne ordered the Dragonfyre to destroy the Gate to Sol, closing the system off to the network for hundreds of years.\\n\\nEarth was saved, but across the network the Terraformer War raged on. Many Terran colonies were razed before the ever-dwindling USC fleet could bring the machines to book.",
      "1121": "Evolution of the Xenon",
      "1122": "It is unknown how many Terraformers ignored or survived the safe self-destruct order issued by the USC in 2099 AD, though it is suspected that most that did were part of the Second Fleet that was furthest away when the order was given.\\n\\nOver the years since, the word Xenomorph, and then Xenon, has been intrinsically connected to the self-controlled and seemingly intelligent machines that have plagued not just the Argon, but all members of the Community of Planets. If, as rumoured, they are the descendants of these Second Fleet Terraformers, then any hint of their objective to create beautiful Earth-like worlds is gone, replaced by an almost obsessive vendetta to annihilate all sentient, biological life.",
      "1131": "Relations with the Terrans Begin to Cool",
      "1132": "After their assistance in dealing with the major Kha'ak offensives at the end of the Kha'ak conflict, the Community of Planets was eager for Sol to join its ranks. The Government of Earth and the Outer Solar System \\(GEOSS\\), the system-wide government of Sol, was willing to undertake a loose alliance with their long-lost cousins, the Argon Federation, alone, but declined the offer to join the Community.\\n\\nOther races were hurt by what they saw as a slight against them, and relations slowly began to cool off, but the Jump Gate network once again knew peace, for a short while.",
      "1141": "Tensions Build over AGI Usage",
      "1142": "In the centuries since Nathan R. Gunne destroyed the Jump Gate leading to Sol, Terrans had fostered a deep distrust of any and all artificial intelligence, something that, despite the threat posed by the Xenon, had not been mirrored by the Community of Planets.\\n\\nThe Terrans made it quite clear that they would not allow their mass-produced ships to be artificial intelligently-controlled, nor would they allow artificial intelligently-controlled ships to enter their space. Additionally, they bid the Community to allow computer-controlled ships to be inspected by the AGI Task Force for any potentially dangerous intelligent systems. The Community of Planets refused.\\n\\nStrictly determined that AGI never again become a threat to Sol, the Terran government ordered the USC and ATF to fly into Argon space.",
      "1151": "The Terran Conflict",
      "1152": "The Community of Planets was quick to see the Terran fleet moving through Argon space as an act of aggression, and reacted accordingly. War fell onto the Jump Gate network once again, and thousands more were killed as the Community came to realise just how advanced Terran technology was in comparison to their own.\\n\\nThere was no hope of the Argon Federation being able to defeat the USC in a direct confrontation. Instead, they drew on Terraformer technology developed in secret by the Beryll; new CPU ships and assembler drones were built, with new Jump Gates also built to maintain supply lines.",
      "1161": "The Destruction of the Torus Aeternal",
      "1162": "Saya Kho, serving for some time as an Argon Secret Service agent on Earth, feared greatly that the Terran Conflict would lead to the defeat of her beloved Argon Prime. In the absence of sound alternatives, she was forced to take extreme measures.\\n\\nShe and Sherman Hiatu, an Argon double agent stationed in the Sol system, devised a plan to destroy Earth's last line of defence, the Torus Aeternal, coordinating with the Federal and Beryll fleets to strike the planet as soon as the space station had been removed.\\n\\nIn 778 NT, they put their plan into action. They initiated an emergency procedure known as segment-separation. Torus Aeternal would separate into its constituent 420 segments that drifted into a higher orbit, hereby irrevocably destroying the Torus. Although the number of casualties was low because the segments sealed themselves to act as lifeboats, some individuals in the connecting elements were killed, among them Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu. Neither body was ever found.",
      "1171": "The Flight of the Winterblossom",
      "1172": "With a connection to the vast alien Jump Gate network established in 2042 AD, the scientific community of Earth and the USC worked together to build Earth's first interstellar ship. The entire population of Earth was swept up in an unprecedented level of star-fever and the project took place under immense pressure, but three years after its construction began, in 2046 AD, the USCSS Winterblossom, captained by René Farnham, was ready to face the stars.\\n\\nAfter a two-year journey through the Jump Gate network, the Winterblossom returned to Earth with results suggesting hundreds, possibly thousands of star systems. However, there was no trace of the Gates' builders, or any other intelligent life. Humanity, it seemed then, was alone.",
      "1181": "Warp Instability",
      "1182": "First in -24 NT, connections between all Jump Gates, including those made by Earth, were unexpectedly severed, and then, just as surprisingly, re-established. Terran scouts were the first to realise that the network now had different configuration than before the disconnect.\\n\\nThen, starting during the Terran Conflict, the Jump Gates once again began to destabilise, with Jump Gates opening and closing, first sporadically and then on an almost daily basis before, in 782 NT once again shutting down completely.\\n\\nTheorists suggest that these shutdowns line up with extreme rises in the aggression of the Xenon, or other artificial intelligence threats, and question whether it may be an attempt to slow the destruction of intelligent biological life.",
      "1191": "The Jump Gate Shutdown",
      "1192": "When in 782 NT the Jump Gate network was suddenly disconnected, as every single active Gate suddenly deactivated without warning, the universe was thrown into chaos. Scores of star systems that depended on resources coming in from other territories were thrown into anarchy and war as, in their panic, people fought for survival. Diplomatic relationships and alliances that had stood the test of time were altogether destroyed. The fate of many star systems, and many people, is yet to be uncovered. The Community of Planets, after 268 years, ceased to exist.",
      "1201": "The Alliance of the Word",
      "1202": "In 801 NT, nineteen years after the death of the Community of Planets, messenger drones from Sacred Relic appeared in Argon Prime and Kingdom End, bringing word from the Paranid that they were attempting to find out the reason for the shutdown and send any aid they could. These Paranid called themselves the Alliance of the Word, offering some kind of communication between star systems, even if interstellar travel was no longer possible.\\n\\nThe Alliance of the Word still operates in Sacred Relic to this day, sending automated scouts to systems still trapped outside the newly connected Jump Gate network, in the hope that they may find out who has survived the dark times, and send aid to them if necessary.",
      "1211": "The President's End Massacre",
      "1212": "The Argon colony of President's End had no military ships and a minimal security force when unknown alien ships jumped into the system with the use of fully-functional jump drives. There was barely time to breathe before these same ships opened fire on station and ship alike, tearing the small colony apart in under an hour, jumping away before the nearest Federal fleet could respond.\\n\\nThe Split would go on to name this new threat the Kha'ak, after a folk-tale told to scare children, and the Community of Planets would fight a bitter fight against them for a number of years. President's End never recovered from this onslaught, with ships and stations left to rust where they had been annihilated by the Kha'aks' deadly kyon beam weapons.",
      "1221": "The Battle of Omicron Lyrae",
      "1222": "The most famous battle of the Kha'ak campaign, the Battle for Omicron Lyrae saw Community hero Kyle Brennan unwillingly used to control a devastating Kha'ak M0 battleship, with weapons larger and more terrifying than anything ever seen by the Community of Planets.\\n\\nOnly the intervention of Julian Brennan, Saya Kho and Bret Serra, all named Heroes of the Community of Planets for their efforts, stopped the M0 from destroying the heavily colonised planet of Omicron Lyrae, rescuing Kyle from the clutches of the Kha'ak. While Julian and Saya went on to play important roles in the finding of Earth and the Terran Conflict respectively, Bret was killed in the attempt to rescue Kyle and save the system.",
      "1231": "Operation: Final Fury",
      "1232": "Though the M0-class battleship used by the Kha'ak at the Battle of Omicron Lyrae was destroyed, and no more were seen during the rest of the Kha'ak campaign, the Kha'ak remained a dangerous threat to the Community of Planets for some time. The tide only turned against them when a connection to the Sol Gate was re-established, and the technologically advanced USC fleet were able to stifle the last major Kha'ak offensive.\\n\\nAfter that, the Community of Planets was able to organise a counter-attack against the Kha'ak, using information gathered from Kha'ak ships to locate the hive's point of origin and destroy it. This operation was known as Operation: Final Fury and is seen as the end of the Kha'ak campaign.",
      "1241": "The Gates Reopen",
      "1242": "Though it is impossible to know when the first of the thousands of Jump Gates throughout the universe reopened, or which it was, the first instance recorded by the Alliance of the Word of a reopening was in 803 NT, reconnecting Sacred Relic to Pious Mists \\(then an unexplored system\\). Messenger drones they had sent to nearby systems soon returned with more news of open Gates.\\n\\nFor near to twenty years Jump Gates continued to open and close much as they had before 782 NT, some sporadically opening, closing and reopening to a new location, some turning on and immediately stabilising.",
      "1251": "The Gate Network Stabilises",
      "1252": "In the twenty years after first reports of reopened Jump Gates arrived in Sacred Relic, the Alliance of the Word continued to study Jump Gates and as many unstable warp anomalies as they could for any pattern or reasoning behind the instability of the system.\\n\\nThough they were unable to garner much, they were able to find a noticeable pattern. As time passed, more and more Gates were not only remaining open, but also stable. By 820 NT, they had gathered enough data to be able to confirm publicly that the new Jump Gate network was completely safe to traverse.",
      "1261": "Earth Scientists Create Jump Gates",
      "1262": "In 2022 AD \\(-148 NT\\) Ashizava Kazuko made a startling discovery: it was indeed possible to travel faster than the speed of light with finite energy. Kazuko had successfully established the principle of the tunnel-jump.\\n\\nScepticism was rife, but repeated experiments showed that the previously unknown student was indeed correct. Very soon, two huge Jump Gates were built; one sent to Mars and the other to Proxima Centauri, in humankind's first attempt at interstellar travel.\\n\\nIn 2041, contact with the ship carrying the Proxima Gate was lost, but after a year of frantic research, the Sol Gate once again found a connection. Scientists were stunned to discover that it had not connected with the Proxima Gate, but an unknown Gate in a distant region of the Milky Way.\\n\\nUtterly by chance, humankind had stumbled across an entire network of Jump Gates of unknown origin. It was an invitation that could not be turned down.",
      "1271": "The Terraformer Project is Terminated",
      "1272": "The use of artificially intelligent ships to help in Earth's colonisation efforts sent shockwaves across the scientific community. Many argued the move would drastically accelerate the terraforming process without incurring the resultant increase in construction costs, and it was undeniable that there were huge economic and social benefits to humankind. Others questioned whether the use of truly intelligent machines was in fact slavery. Many were drawn into countless arguments over the definition of sentience.\\n\\nThe Terraformer Project's condemnation though, came in the form of mathematicians and programmers that proved without a doubt that goal drift - changes made to the original programming of the Terraformers caused by machine evolution - could not be ruled out. This, they argued, was a profound danger to intelligent life throughout the galaxy.\\n\\nIn 2099 AD, the World Government ordered that a safe self-destruct program be patched into the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets' software, causing the immediate destruction of all Terraformer units."
