When the connection flickered into activation, Fleet Command immediately cast its net wide in an attempt to uncover potential Jump Gates leading further into the depths of space. To facilitate this grand expansionary effort, the newly discovered system was to be transformed into a densely colonised foothold; an initiative that was selflessly supported by many of the more influential, wealthy families of Argon Prime(same as {20005,9810}). After an initial dispute over equitable distribution of real estate which was settled by the Federal Presidency, officially tying these entitlements to unalterable obligations as part of the colonisation process, the system saw a steady influx of settlers. However, just a few months later, the spotlight of attention shifted away from the once-promising colony. As more and more gates began to reopen, federal interest in The Reach rapidly dwindled, transforming it into the quiescent backwater system of today. To budding explorers and entrepreneurs, this new status carries with it a number of obvious benefits, most notably including an as yet comfortable distance to any military threats, which allows them to test their skills in a relatively forgiving environment. Moreover, the comparatively long period since its discovery has given the local aristocrats ample opportunity to build up a quasi-feudal power structure, turning the system into a slow and steady supplier for the local economy.","80001":"{20005,9011}(Silent Witness)","80002":"Silent Witness(same as {20003,80001}) has established itself as vitally important to galactic trade, as its ring highway is the main connection between Argon and Teladi space.

Pilots are frequently harassed by pirates, and it is not uncommon for trade ships to vanish completely. Despite calls for improved security, only parts of the system have been claimed and are actively patrolled; it is simply too big a task to weed out the criminal elements inhabiting the further reaches of the system.

Regardless of the actual sequence of events, the invaders were forced to withdraw, and the system was ordered to be thoroughly fortified as both first line of defence and last bastion against the Argon threat.

It was not uncommon for the crews stationed on the rigged ships to be oblivious to their strategies. Incredibly successful at first, their conduct eventually alienated them from their fellow Split families. When Patriarch Zyarth's fleet approached their Gate, Family Njy realised too late that they stood alone. They were succeeded by the family Kritt, who were careful to not repeat their predecessors' mistake.

They would have faded away, were it not for the Patriarch of all Split at the time recognising the value of an indebted and fragile family in close proximity to Teladi systems. The Family Tkr was offered protection from the other families by the Patriarch as long as they supplied him with slaves and resources from outside Split space.

All the prevailing theories share in common that a weapons production facility was the epicentre of the explosion.

When Jump Gates shut down, the Teladi in this system were left to their own devices, and their conduct shifted further away from that of the regular Teladi Company. In order to survive the isolation, they increased trade with the Split and tailored their supply to the Split's needs for labour.

With no voice to guide them, the parishes had no choice but to band together and flee through the Litany of Fury(same as {20005,3016}), as out of crimson skies a gate appeared that led them back into the fold of their long-lost brethren.

Its intended function was to re-establish contact with Terran colonies outside the Sol system, in an attempt to maintain some influence over Commonwealth politics.\\n\\nAs a result of hosting this additional gate, the sector also came to serve as the logical point of origin for the Pioneer Initiative, which was sent out to further develop Brennan's Triumph and the outer rim of Sol, and which would eventually evolve into the Segaris Pioneers.","1110011":"{20005,7022}(Pluto)","1110012":"The dwarf planet Pluto(same as {20004, 1110011}) is the largest object in the Kuiper Belt and, as such, was the obvious choice for the establishment of a base of operations for Kuiper Belt-based mining corporations.

However, its missing return lane does make returning to the Yaki base of operations an arduous and potentially dangerous task. The proximity to the Xenon, while unsafe, also has also proven to be the Yaki pirates' greatest asset.

However, as the Split systems started to reconnect, and the situation concerning the Free Families began to deteriorate, Patriarch Zyarth was worried about how much more dangerous the Free Families could be if they ever joined forces with Family Valka. To get ahead of this potential problem, Patriarch Zyarth offered the Valka pirates control over Wretched Skies(same as {20003, 4000001}).

At first they experimented with austere, spatially efficient housing complexes in the crevices of tethered asteroids. At some point, while deconstructing a freighter to attach its life-support systems to one of these asteroids, the ordained priest engineers found that they could modify its shield generator output, significantly lessening the protection from physical impact but at the same time greatly expanding the shield coverage; a discovery which they believed would consecrate their settlements against the metaphysical threats present in the system. Over the following two decades, more and more station complexes sprang up that used this adaptation of shield technology to facilitate the construction of large, specialised screen modules able to protect their habitation units.

but at its core it remains fundamentally the same.\\n\\nThe capacious front-facing hangar allows the carrier to quickly issue forth large waves of fighters to meet an enemy fleet head-on. In any fleet, a carrier is the central platform from which to coordinate large-scale fighter-based manoeuvres, and the Terran model does this with aplomb, whether the theatre of battle is on Sol's doorstep, or in a hostile system far removed from Terran domain.","60201":"Osaka","60211":"This state of the art version of the Osaka(same as {20101,60201})-class destroyer is the result of meticulously redesigning and overhauling its predecessor model. The design retained the two-pronged front bow of the older ship, while adopting an elongated rear section more typical of contemporary Terran designs.\\n\\nDestroyer-class ships usually play an important role in engaging large enemy targets, while also serving as an anchor point for larger fleet movement. The Terran Protectorate's Osaka, however, specialises only in the first of these two roles, leaving coordination duties to the fleet's carriers and battleships.","60301":"Kyoto","60401":"Cutlass","60501":"Scimitar","60601":"Sabre","60701":"Rapier","60711":"After the restructuring that saw the end of the USC, several changes were implemented by the Terran Protectorate to reform the way that the Sol system was policed. Along with these structural changes, several ship designs were drastically overhauled. The Rapier(same as {20101,60701}) was redesigned to be lighter and faster, in order to cover more ground and improve the military's response time. These changes also resulted in the ship's somewhat unconventional, but still recognisable, new form.","60801":"Katana","60811":"A sleek Corvette-class ship, the Katana(same as {20101,60801}) was engineered to be as compact as possible and minimise its surface area as a potential target. The front-facing weapons make it the Terran Protectorate's first choice for engaging individual targets, as they concentrate all of its available fire-power in one place.","60901":"Yokohama","61001":"Claymore","61101":"Khopesh","61201":"Shotel","61301":"Falx","61311":"In the years since the Jump Gates realigned, this Protectorate-made support ship has become a cornerstone of the Terran fleets. The Falx(same as {20101, 61301}) is heavily inspired by the Argon Cerberus(same as {20101,10601}) frigate, although the Terran engineers would never admit to that. Because it can carry a small-sized ship on board, it is often used for patrols. Should it encounter hostile forces, it can hold its own in combat until Terran reinforcements arrive, and on the distant fronts of the war against the Xenon it often acts as a reliable support ship.","61401":"Gladius","61411":"With its distinctive sweeping wings, the Gladius(same as {20101, 61401}) was designed for medium to long distance travel, as well as engaging both small- and medium-sized ships in combat. These design criteria were carefully chosen, and the ship trades manoeuvrability for the ability to absorb more damage. The design focuses on allowing the ship to reach far-away pockets of the Jump Gate network, as part of the Terran Protectorate's new, more interventionist, policy in combating the Xenon.","61501":"Paramerion","61601":"Jian","61611":"A successor to the Claymore(same as {20101,61001}), the Jian(same as {20101,61601}) is immediately distinguishable from its predecessor by its numerous turrets. Designed during the Jump Gate shutdown, the Terran Protectorate sought to create a more heavily armed, yet still nimble, gunboat. With its turrets capable of applying pressure in several directions simultaneously, it is easy for the Jian to switch rapidly between targets, allowing it to keep enemy fighter groups at bay.","61701":"Dao","61801":"Kopis","61802":"(Kopis \\(Mineral\\)){20101,61801} {20111,3101}","61803":"(Kopis \\(Gas\\)){20101,61801} {20111,3201}","61811":"The Kopis(same as {20101,61801}) can feel quite claustrophobic when compared to mining ships from other manufacturers. Putting function over comfort, however, was a conscious design decision, since it allowed the engineers to maximise cargo space and thereby increase the profitability of each trip.","61812":"{20101,61811}","61813":"{20101,61811}","61901":"Falchion","62001":"Makhaira","62101":"Bolo","62102":"(Bolo \\(Mineral\\)){20101,62101} {20111,3101}","62103":"(Bolo \\(Gas\\)){20101,62101} {20111,3201}","62111":"As is occasionally the case with emerging technology, the shift from station-based mining technology to the more efficient and adaptable approach of ship-based mining, came about in several disconnected regions of the Jump Gate network almost simultaneously. While the Argon-based Plutarch Mining Corporation developed their initial prototypes, several Sol-based corporations reached the same conclusion independently. When the Jump Gates realigned, both sides tried to sell their technological innovations to the other, only to realise that the market was already saturated.","62112":"{20101,62111}","62113":"{20101,62111}","62201":"Kukri","62211":"Initially used by the Terran Protectorate to hunt down the remnants of pirate organisations inside the Sol system, this Fighter-class model soon established itself as the small, nimble ship of choice for Terran military operations, both inside and outside their home system.\\n\\nThe asymmetric design neatly brings together firepower and manoeuvrability, and ensures that this ship excels in being adaptable to whatever opposition the pilot faces. The design also factored-in specialised weapon slots, which allow the ship to make use of powerful weapons, unique to the Terran arsenal.","62301":"Nimcha","62311":"The Nimcha(same as {20101,62301}) was developed as a light and fast scout, capable of holding its own even outside heavily patrolled Terran Protectorate territory. It differs from other scout ships of similar size by having a noticeably larger cargo capacity. This means that, in the rare instances when the Protectorate requires a limited load to be delivered to a distant front quickly, the Nimcha can conveniently double as a courier, able to operate even when the destination is behind enemy lines.","62401":"Takoba","62411":"Much like the Kalis(same as {20101,62601}), the Takoba(same as {20101,62401}) came about as the result of Segaris Pioneers engineers' modifications to military ships provided to them by the Terran Protectorate, though in this case the ships were mostly decommissioned examples, sold to the Pioneers at a reduced price. Sleek in design, and distinguished from other fighters primarily by its speed, ships of this class are often dispatched to explore unfamiliar territory in which some enemy presence is expected. While useful for small-scale military action, the Takoba is not as adept at engaging the enemy head-on, as its shielding is somewhat weaker than the Terran fighters on which it was based.","62501":"Tsurugi","62601":"Kalis","62611":"When the Pioneer Initiative set out to claim systems beyond the confines of Sol, they were supplied with Kukri(same as {20101,62201})-class fighters by the Terran military. Many of these ships, however, came with faulty components, as they were production units that had failed rigorous Terran acceptance testing. The brilliant minds among the Pioneer Initiative worked hard to address these flaws with the limited means available to them and, over time, modified the ships so much that they became almost unrecognisable.\\n\\nNow much more standardised, the Kalis(same as {20101,62601})-class fighter serves as a sturdier and more reliable Pioneer alternative to its Terran forerunner. The hostile environments in which the Segaris Pioneers operate require a heavily protected ship, so this unconventional design bridges the gap between standard and heavy fighters. It provides handling similar to the latter, due to its heavy shielding, while still being cheaper to produce for the struggling fledgling faction.","62701":"Sapporo","62801":"Nagoya","62901":"Chiba","63001":"Sendai","63101":"Frog","63111":"The Frog(same as {20101,63101}) has established itself as the Courier-class ship of choice for anyone who is looking to quickly traverse the Sol system, transporting a limited amount of cargo. The design does not include a defensive arsenal, but since pilots of this ship are not generally expected to leave the Terran Protectorate's sphere of security, it should not really be needed.","63201":"Baldric","63211":"The Baldric(same as {20101,63201}) transporter has long been a staple of the Terran economy. The newest iteration allows for greater modularity and more extensive modification options, and adjusts the design to be more in-line with the Terran Protectorate's modern aesthetic. It also adds an extra turret to make it a less attractive target for pirate raids, and to ensure that no wares critical to the Terran war effort are lost in transit.","63301":"Scabbard","63401":"Honshu","63411":"This auxiliary ship, the Honshu(same as {20101, 63401}), is noticeably slower than competitors' supply ships. While other ships of this type are usually aimed at providing immediate, short-term support for a fleet, this ship is designed to take part in long-distance operations that often lead Terran Protectorate fleets far away from Sol, and far also from allied harbours. For this reason, the design sacrifices speed for an exceptionally large storage capacity. However, this is not the only part of the ship that is engineered for long-range travel. Its most distinctive visual feature is its solar sail, which generates additional energy that can be made available to the ship's systems during extended journeys into hostile space.","63501":"Hokkaido","63502":"(Hokkaido \\(Mineral\\)){20101,63501} {20111,3101}","63503":"(Hokkaido \\(Gas\\)){20101,63501} {20111,3201}","63511":"The L-sized Hokkaido(same as {20101,63501}) mining ship comes in two variants, providing support for both natural gas collection and asteroid mineral mining. With the founding of the Pioneer Initiative, this design really came into its own, and has since been widely adopted by the Segaris Pioneers. On the back of the Pioneers' expansion, this ship model has made its way deeper into the Jump Gate network, and has become a common sight in a variety of areas.","63512":"{20101,63511}","63513":"{20101,63511}","63601":"Okinawa","63602":"(Okinawa Research){20101,63601} {20111,1301}","63611":"This comparatively lightweight freighter became the de-facto standard option for trading among Sol's citizens during the Jump Gate shutdown.

Newer iterations, however, have since added an array of turrets along its flanks to discourage the more belligerent inhabitants of the Gate network.","63612":"{20006,102}(No information available)","63701":"Kyushu","63711":"Earlier versions of these Terran construction ships were outfitted with specialist disassembly systems that would allow them to dismantle and transport station debris in a highly efficient manner. This focus on tearing down existing structures came about as the result of the arduous task of clearing the space around Earth from the debris of those parts of the Torus Aeternal that did not drift far enough out of their original orbit. Since that clean-up work is now winding down, more recent examples of this ship model have been built without such capabilities, to save on production costs.","63801":"Shikoku","63901":"Tachi","64001":"Estoc","64101":"Tulwar","64201":"Pata","64301":"Tessak","64401":"Daab","64501":"Shamshir","64601":"Akita","64701":"Kagawa","65000":"(ATF Ships)","65101":"Odin","65201":"Woden","65301":"Tyr","65401":"Valhalla","65501":"Aegir","65601":"Skirnir","65701":"Vali","65801":"Vidar","65901":"Fenrir","66001":"Thor","66101":"Mjollnir","66201":"Valkyrie","66301":"Bragi","66401":"Gefjon","66501":"Yggdrasil","66601":"Asgard","66611":"The Asgard(same as {20101, 66601})-class battleship was designed by the ATF to be a moving fortress, capable of taking on even the most monumental Xenon strongholds and capital ships. It is very slow, but also very powerful, and is especially noteworthy because of its unique forward-facing XL Main Battery(same as {20105,3041}). This weapon makes use of some unique technology that was specifically designed for the ATF, and is no longer available elsewhere. In terms of raw single-shot damage, it is currently the most powerful gun in the known universe.\\n\\nThis was the last ship class designed and produced by the ATF before the organisation was dissolved and its resources absorbed by the Terran Protectorate. Despite the change in administration, the Asgard is still frequently used by the Terran Protectorate because its sheer firepower has yet to be surpassed.","66701":"Loki","66801":"Kvasir","66901":"Syn","66911":"The Syn(same as {20101, 66601})-class destroyer is a remnant of the AGI Task Force fleet. With its three front-facing weapons, it was designed to take on large, slow targets. While most other ATF ships were systematically decommissioned and replaced by the Terran Protectorate, the Syn, due to its specialised nature, was absorbed into the Protectorate's military. While the Terran Protectorate developed their own destroyer-class ship, the Osaka(same as {20101,60201}), they saw sufficient military value in operating two distinct lines of destroyers side by side.","67001":"Freyr","67101":"Skadi","70000":"(Xenon Ships)","70101":"N","70111":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70201":"M","70211":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70301":"P","70311":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70401":"S","70411":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70501":"K","70511":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70601":"I","70611":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70801":"J","70811":"{20006,102}(No information available)","70901":"O","70911":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71001":"L","71011":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71101":"Q","71111":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71201":"R","71211":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71301":"T","71311":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71401":"U","71411":"{20006,102}(No information available)","71501":"V","71511":"{20006,102}(No information available)","79000":"(Terraformer Ships)","79101":"(Unknown Ship){20109,5101}","79111":"{20006,102}(No information available)","80000":"(Pirate Ships)","80101":"Mandalay","80201":"Bayamon","80301":"Orinoco","80401":"Malacca","80501":"Celebes","80601":"Paracel","80701":"Dalian","80801":"Socotra","80901":"Andaman","81001":"Douala","81101":"Gannascus","81201":"Teuta","81301":"Awilda","81401":"Genthus","81501":"Barbarossa","81601":"Donia","81701":"Keymis","81801":"Kyd","81901":"Raleigh","82001":"Bond","82101":"Lecat","82201":"Pardal","82301":"Skytte","82401":"Witherborn","82501":"Barrow","82601":"Claver","82701":"Mascarino","82801":"Lux","82901":"Shih","83001":"Axe","85000":"(Yaki Ships)","85101":"Chokaro","85201":"Susanowa","85301":"Tenjin","85401":"Raijn","85501":"Tonbo","85601":"Fujin","85701":"Washi","85801":"Shuri","85901":"Ryu","86001":"Hoshi","86101":"Akuma","86201":"Akurei","86301":"Senshi","86401":"Kariudo","86501":"Amaterasu","86601":"Kojin","86701":"Moreya","86711":"The Moreya(same as {20101, 86701})-class fighter is a Yaki powerhouse. The initial design was based on hijacked Paranid Pegasus(same as {20101, 30101})-class scouts, which were modified with temperamental Yaki technology to tailor it to their specific requirements. Frequently operating alone in enemy territory, and needing to withstand sustained enemy fire, they added reinforced hull plating for improved defence.

actually a colony but a mining operation, was however repurposed after the Albion gate powered down and as since served as an actual colony and stronghold to PMC senior staff. The fragment of the Broken Moon the station was built into had supposedly been chosen due to a large tunnel leading all the way from one side of the rock to the other allowing easy access to its interior through many shafts driven into its walls. One part of the installation still serves as a mining facility and is commonly referred to as The Mines.","201":"Lonely Giant","202":"Probably a candidate for the title of Profiteroid 2.0 the Lonely Giant brims with a strange concentration of 99% pure Hydrogen-3 in crystalline form. The visible crystals on the surface only amount for a tiny fraction of what deep scans have revealed to be immense chasms on the inside filled up with frozen Hydrogen-3. However, both the reason why the Lonely giant did not yet melt under the heat of Albion's central star nor willingly spread its wealth is the immensely hard silicate a majority of the rock is made up from, giving the PMC a hard time twisting its innards. For the meantime the two massive rocks orbiting one another are held in a containment field trapping the subliming Hydrogen-3 gas emanating from the surface crystals with the pretty side-effect of illuminating the whole scene in a soothing picturesque turquoise as the gas touches the particle barrier.","301":"Core Dig","302":"The Core Dig was the most prominent source for the Iridium isotope Ir-209, also known as the famous 'Unobtainium'. This is a stable and highly heat-resistant anti-ferromagnetic complex agent perfectly suited for fusion reaction containment. Such containment suffered from the previous lack of a material that was not also radio-activated under constant neutron radiation. Iridium-209, formerly considered non-existent in nature and ineffective through cost to synthesise, seemed to fit the bill. Unfortunately, as Matter/Antimatter technology emerged and increased its hold on the reactor market, Unobtainium faced a severe decline in demand and resale value compared to the cost of extraction and processing. The Core Dig now operates with a reduced crew and has redirected its operations to extract and store the trace Nividium also present in the minerals available.","401":"Lost Colony","402":"The crude technology this large installation is based on still bears a glimpse of genius. Its core consists of a series of tunnel connections between some junction structures of different sizes upon which the surrounding gases were made to condense and crystallize under the influence of a chemical catalyst. Today the station has a crystalline coating of varying thickness between 100 and 500 Metres and will most likely form a solid asteroid-like mega-crystal a couple hundred years from now. The Lost Colony already has pioneers dig into the thicker areas of the coating expanding the station into it with some success now which makes it clear that this colony may very well grow into something far more befitting of such name.","601":"The Aqueduct","602":"As the M/AM drives gained popularity this behemoth among freshwater supply stations was quickly abandoned in favour of more readily accessible water sources. Before that however the Aqueduct was the Maelstrom system's largest freshwater supply installation and probably one of the largest facilities of its kind in the known universe. Today it is being swarmed by Xenon who lurk within the dense clouds of frozen H2O that span the space between the many asteroids around the Sable Vortex.","701":"The Maze","702":"Named for the countless natural and artificial tunnels that snake through it, the Maze is the huge broken asteroid in which the Jump Gate in Fields of Opportunity is situated. The nature of the tunnels, which run from one end of the asteroid to the other, lead the Teladi to believe that the Maze was broken up for mining by one of the system's previous occupants, though there is no evidence to suggest who these settlers may have been.","801":"Overwatch","802":"Though Overwatch still receives a supply of Teladianium from the foundries in Fields of Opportunity, after a Jump Gate realignment the Habitat-class \"superstation\" was cut off from most of the technology it requires to manufacture ships from its dedicated shipyard. Even though it now depends on Albion for these technologies, Overwatch still has much to offer the system, since it provides food and energy to all the stations still scattered across Serpentine Haze and Fatal Path. More importantly, however, it is home to thousands of Teladi civilians and the headquarters of the Teladi Union, making it the first port of call for any traveller coming to Fields of Opportunity.","901":"War Memorial","902":"The Teladi of Fields of Opportunity have always struggled against the Xenon that exist on the outskirts of the system, but mass incursions into the system by the Xenon are rare. When they have occurred, however, they have always ended in bloodshed. The so-called \"War Memorial\" is perhaps the largest of the battle scars, and was left in the far north of Serpentine Haze in commemoration of the Teladi who sacrificed themselves to make sure their comrades would escape unharmed.\\n\\nRealising that they did not have the firepower to push the Xenon back, three Teladi captains ordered their crews to abandon ship before ramming the Branch 9 Xenon K leading the attack and causing it to crash into the side of an asteroid. The subsequent explosion destroyed everything in the vicinity, but ended what had been one of the Teladi's most vicious and bloody conflicts.","1001":"Stronghold","1002":"(Stronghold description)This Split station has been taken over by an Argon slave insurrection.","1101":"Monument of Eternity","1102":"{20006,302}(No information available)(Monument of Eternity description)","1201":"Apotheosis(paranid monument)","1202":"This vast and ornate cathedral constitutes a centrepiece of Paranid tradition, a blazing symbol of its architects' imperishable past and future.

To the Paranid, however, the Conclave of the Three represents a logical conclusion to an excruciating mathematical impossibility, at long last facilitating the glorious consolidation of the realm and the unification of its people.","2301":"Torus Aeternal Segment #34(speak Torus Aeternal as provided in sound sample, speak # as \"number\", speak 34 as \"thirty-four\")","2302":"The Torus Aeternal was an orbital ring station encircling and guarding planet Earth until the advent of the Second Terraformer War. The structure's scale and capabilities were unprecedented within the Jump Gate network. Tethers kept the station in a stable orbit and allowed for the transportation of people and wares between the station and the planet. While the outward-facing sections were completed, many of the sections facing Earth were still under construction. This limited the number of people present on the Torus Aeternal to an estimated 1 million.\\n\\nThe Torus Aeternal was ultimately destroyed during the Second Terraformer War. Two Argon infiltrators, Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu, initiated an emergency procedure known as segment-separation, during which the station separated into its 420 constituent segments and drifted into higher orbit, irrevocably destroying the Torus. This destruction of the Torus triggered all out war with the Argon Federation(same as {20203,201}).","2401":"(Destroyed Jump Gate)","2402":"Centuries old, this Gate wreckage is a sombre memorial to the First Terraformer War. It reminds the Terrans of the Xenon roots in Terran technology, the Xenon threat to the survival of Earth, and the sacrifices the Terrans had to make. Had it not been for the heroic actions of the Dragonfly, drawing the Terraformers through this Gate before its destruction, Earth and all humans in Sol would have succumbed to the machines. The resulting 500 years of isolation, knowing what lies beyond and yet confined to this small corner of the galaxy, were considered a small price to pay for the survival of Earth.","2501":"(Terran Jump Gate)","2502":"After the rediscovery of the lost colony of Aldrin, the former United Space Command decided to establish a lasting Jump Gate connection. The commissioned Jump Gate would be the third Gate created by Terran engineering. Neptune was chosen as the location for the new Jump Gate, its distance to Earth being a compromise; close enough for trade, but far enough not to become a major safety risk. The connection served people from both sides, allowing for economic, scientific and cultural exchange after centuries of separation. Like the rest of the gate network, this connection was lost during the Jump Gate shutdown.\\n\\nEven with the Second Terraformer War on hold and the Jump Gate shutdown in progress, Terran relations with the Community of Planets were still poor at best. This led the Terran High Command to set up a covert operation to re-establish a connection using the Neptune Gate. The Terrans chose to connect the Gate to an old Gate in the Brennan's Triumph system, originally destroyed during the First Terraformer War. After moving the alien Jump Gate to the far outskirts of Brennan's Triumph and repairing it, the Terrans managed to establish a connection and keep it secret for several years. After the Jump Gate in the Asteroid Belt shut down, the Neptune Gate prevented Sol from being fully disconnected from the Gate network once again. With the help of an independent entrepreneur, the Terrans connected the outskirts of Brennan's Triumph with its core, establishing their hegemony over the system.","2601":"Torus Aeternal

When the Gates reconnected, the Zyarth Patriarchy emerged as the clear victor. Many long-established Patriarchs had died during those tumultuous times.

Behind this facade, a corrupt organisation began to form, determined to undermine the authority of the very government that had originally permitted its rise. The Buccaneers were led by the shadowy and cunning Pirate Duke who unified smugglers, pirates and other discontent denizens of this largely unexplored and unstable region under his rule. During the Terran Conflict, which forcefully distracted the Paranid Pontifex's attention, Duke's Haven(same as {20103,1401}) was established as the faction headquarters in a newly discovered border system. That system was later grandiosely renamed Lasting Vengeance(same as {20005,9001}), presumably in honour of one of the Duke's driving motivations in the subsequent escalation.\\n\\nThe Duke's Buccaneers were infamous for requiring absolute commitment from their members, demanding that they cut all former ties, and sending them on dangerous infiltration and assassination missions against their former affiliates to prove their allegiance. For most of the faction's supporters, this made maintaining good standings with major political powers, or even pirate organisations, nigh on impossible, and over time resulting in them serving only the Buccaneers. Eventually, political tensions rose and the Buccaneers became hunted by their Paranid neighbours, leading to attacks on their headquarters itself. Regardless of the meticulous planning and seeming precision of those strikes, they never managed to corner or kill the pirate leader himself. The Duke always seemed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, all the while giving his loyal subjects ample opportunity to make a profit in the ensuing chaos.\\n\\nAccording to the sparse pre-shutdown records, during a wave of warp instabilities between 780 and 782 NT, the Pirate Duke was on the verge of achieving his grandest scheme yet, when suddenly, the Buccaneers headquarters in Lasting Vengeance, and with it a large part of the admiralty, was cut off from the rest of the network. The faction as a whole, like many others at the time, dispersed quickly, with only a handful of small pirate bands continuing to vie for control of the now-isolated systems of the New Duchy. After the realignment of the Jump Gates, the Buccaneers were at first thought extinct.

In the wake of this diplomatic disaster, military economies across the network received a welcome boost, as the newly forged Duke's Tempest plunged the Paranid systems into a three-way holy war.

It has, however, been theorised that something far less spiritual lies at the heart of their strategic outlook on the schism.

All attempts at re-establishing official contact have failed, and on the scant occasions when a pilot has actually managed to communicate with a Yaki, the Yaki pilots' behaviour could only be described as bizarre and their ramblings incoherent.

Separated from the network, their economy thrived and the Terran Protectorate fortified their presence in Sol. Critics of the Terran government have claimed that establishing the Protectorate was merely an attempt to re-brand the USC, and that the underlying structural problems remained. However, there is no disputing that the Terran Protectorate does now operate differently from its predecessors. Not only is the Protectorate extremely zealous in its defence of the inner core of Sol, to the point where not even all Terran citizens are allowed to approach Earth, but they are also heavily involved in Sol's external relations. Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network. Fleets are regularly sent out to ensure that Xenon pockets are eradicated, without regard for the sovereignty of the space in question. Nor do they shy away from actively trying to meddle in other governments' affairs in order to influence their stance on AGI technology. Their preoccupation with destroying the Xenon at all costs frequently puts them at odds with the Community of Planets.","3003":"TER","3004":"Protectorate","3101":"Unknown Faction","3102":"{20006,102}(No information available)","3103":"???","3104":"Unknown(Faction)","10101":"Criminal","10102":"{20006,102}(No information available)","10104":"{20203,10101}","10201":"Enemy","10202":"{20006,102}(No information available)","10204":"{20203,10201}","10301":"Civilian","10302":"{20006,102}(No information available)","10304":"{20203,10301}","20101":"Visitor","20102":"{20006,102}(No information available)","20104":"{20203,20101}"}},"20207":{"title":"Licences","translations":{"1000":"(* Police Licences *)","1001":"Federation Police Licence","1002":"The issuing faction for this licence is a Police Authority(same as {1001,9601}).

peak of Xenon activity in the Community of Planets, in 742 NT, a ship from Earth would arrive in Seizewell, a star system controlled by the Teladi Company, using a functioning jump drive.\\n\\nThough there was much ado about the Terran pilot and his extraordinary ship, Kyle William Brennan quickly proved his mettle by volunteering to aid in the Second Xenon Conflict, using the Terran technology equipped on the USC X, which far outstripped anything available in the Community of Planets, to cripple the Xenon central supply and power facilities. For his feat, Brennan was named \"The Hero of the Xenon Conflict\".","1011":"A New Threat Emerges","1012":"Years after Kyle Brennan's heroism, his son through Ninu Gardna was arrested for ties to the Yaki Syndicate. Though Julian Gardna-Brennan chose rehabilitation over imprisonment, his chance for true redemption came weeks later as the Argon colony of President's End was laid to waste by a fleet of unknown alien spaceships, later named the Kha'ak after a Split folk-tale.\\n\\nThe Kha'ak were relentless in their assaults, striking all across the Jump Gate network. The offensive could only be stopped by Julian and his close friends, Saya Kho and Brett Serra, who chased the Kha'ak to Omicron Lyrae, where they were using Julian's father to unwillingly control an M0-class battleship.\\n\\nJulian was able to rescue his father, and halt the Kha'ak assault on the system, but only at the cost of Brett Serra's life.","1021":"The Race To Find Earth","1022":"After the Battle of Omicron Lyrae, Kyle Brennan's desperate search for Earth became a staple of public opinion for many months. There were even those who believed his story and followed in his footsteps. These few included Ion, a Goner, who asked Julian Brennan for his assistance in claiming Kha'ak technology to build a new Jump Gate to Earth.\\n\\nWith the task completed, Kyle - still with an active connection to the Kha'ak hive - accidentally lead the Kha'ak directly to the Gate, and then to Earth itself. If the Kha'ak expected a swift victory in Sol, however, they were denied it, as the far superior USC fleet, greatly improved since their disconnect from the Jump Gate network, awaited them.","1031":"First Contact with the Paranid","1032":"In the wake of the Terraformer Conflict that had seen the Argon separated from their Terran roots, paranoia was so rife among them that peaceful negotiation between them and the first alien species they encountered was difficult to induce.\\n\\nFirst identified by the Argon as Xenomorphs, then as Xenon \\(before the word was irrevocably connected with the descendants of the Terraformer fleet\\), tentative diplomatic talks with the Paranid began in 130 NT, after years of small skirmishes wherein both races had refused to identify themselves.\\n\\nProgress was slow, with neither race trusting the other, but eventually trade and information exchanges were negotiated that benefited the Argon and Paranid both technologically and culturally.","1041":"Foundation of the Federation","1042":"Building themselves up from nothing after facing complete annihilation by the Terraformers in the Terraformer Conflict, the Argon spread throughout the Jump Gate network at a far slower rate than the original Terran settlers.\\n\\nDuring this time, there were of course many disagreements over the direction of the Argon people, leading to the secession of both the Hatikvah Free League \\(original\\) and Free State of Solara from Argon Prime leadership. Despite their differences, however, they were able to join in an alliance, and in 241 NT the covenant creating the Argon Federation, with Argon Prime as its capital, was signed.","1051":"First Contact with the Boron","1052":"It was nearly two hundred years after first contact between the Argon and Paranid, in 323 NT, that first contact with the Queendom of Boron was made. The Boron were very open to treaty negotiations, and it was a mere four months after first contact that trade and cultural accords were signed between Argon Prime and Kingdom End, the Boron home system. These accords formed a strong basis for Argon-Boron relations that have lasted ever since; the foundation upon which a close friendship between the two races was built.\\n\\nThe Paranid, less trusting than the Argon, refused to sign treaties so quickly with a race with whom they had had so little contact.","1061":"The Boron Campaign","1062":"The peace that all three of the Argon, Paranid and Boron had known for a year after the Argon-Boron treaties were signed was suddenly shattered when the Queendom was attacked by a fleet of unknown ships accompanied by a flotilla of Paranid ships. The Boron were only able to survive the conflict with the help of the Argon, who were furious with the Paranid because of their sudden aggression.\\n\\nThe Split, to whom the ships of unknown design had belonged, quickly made themselves known as an aggressive and war-hungry people who wished to challenge themselves against all, and for a number of years, small skirmishes with the Split were known to occur both in Boron and Argon space.","1071":"The Community of Planets","1072":"In an effort to avoid further violence between the Argon, Boron, Paranid and Split, the Community of Planets was founded in 328 NT, pledging to work together in all things and against all threats in unity. Attempts were at first unsuccessful, with only the Argon and the Boron joining the Community in a so-named \"Guild of Founders\". The Paranid and Split, respective relations with the Argon and Boron still in ruin, refused to join, instead making their own alliance.","1081":"200 Years of Cold War","1082":"Following the initial and somewhat failed founding of the Community of Planets, there were years of cold war between the Argon and the Boron, and the Paranid and the Split. Though all races saw moderate economic growth and technological achievement, it was fuelled predominantly by the necessity to be ready for war.\\n\\nThis cold-war state was finally broken in 489 NT when the Paranid, after much long and difficult diplomacy, agreed to join the Community of Planets. Though for another twenty-five years the Split Patriarchy stubbornly believed they could stand alone, they too were brought into the fold, in 514 NT, when the second formal founding of the Community of Planets was completed.","1091":"First Contact with the Teladi","1092":"Contact with another species calling itself the Teladi was made in 550 NT. Ostensibly searching for their lost home, Ianamus Zura, the newcomers proved themselves shrewd business people with the uncanny ability to make the best of even the worst situation. Their introverted nature and ubiquitous tendency towards avarice proved uncomfortable to other races, but their financial brilliance all but assured them a place within the Community of Planets.\\n\\nSuch was their dominance over other races in business and economic fields that the Teladi quickly became the primary financial power within the Community, even introducing the Credit as a Community-wide currency to great success.","1101":"The Terraformer Project Begins","1102":"In the wake of the USCSS Winterblossom's discovery of an entirely empty, alien Jump Gate network, there were immediate and numerous calls for a colonisation programme.\\n\\nWhile rendering planets suitable for human habitation was possible with then modern Terran technology, it was still slow and arduous. Instead of sending human crews out for decades to complete this task, fleets of intelligent robot vessels, Terraformers, were designed and built to complete it with speed, efficiency and far less risk.\\n\\nOver the course of thirty years from 2066 AD, the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets were sent out into the network to terraform a dozen planets inside their stars' biospheres.","1111":"The Terraformer Conflict","1112":"In 2145 \\(-25 NT\\), fleets of mutated, long-forgotten Terraformer ships, thought destroyed by the safe self-destruct command issued forty-six years prior, appeared in orbit around Earth, their terraforming tools turned into weapons of war as billions died in the ensuing firefight around Sol. The USC was caught unprepared, with few ships and minimal crews on each. The war put all previous conflicts to shade.\\n\\nIn 2146, the crew of the USCSS Dragonfyre, Nathan Ridley Gunne, Poul Vantera and Frank de Vries, lured the Terraformer away from Earth, through a Jump Gate connected to the larger, alien network stumbled upon by the USCSS Winterblossom. As the Terraformer fleet followed the USC fleet away, Gunne ordered the Dragonfyre to destroy the Gate to Sol, closing the system off to the network for hundreds of years.\\n\\nEarth was saved, but across the network the Terraformer War raged on. Many Terran colonies were razed before the ever-dwindling USC fleet could bring the machines to book.","1121":"Evolution of the Xenon","1122":"It is unknown how many Terraformers ignored or survived the safe self-destruct order issued by the USC in 2099 AD, though it is suspected that most that did were part of the Second Fleet that was furthest away when the order was given.\\n\\nOver the years since, the word Xenomorph, and then Xenon, has been intrinsically connected to the self-controlled and seemingly intelligent machines that have plagued not just the Argon, but all members of the Community of Planets. If, as rumoured, they are the descendants of these Second Fleet Terraformers, then any hint of their objective to create beautiful Earth-like worlds is gone, replaced by an almost obsessive vendetta to annihilate all sentient, biological life.","1131":"Relations with the Terrans Begin to Cool","1132":"After their assistance in dealing with the major Kha'ak offensives at the end of the Kha'ak conflict, the Community of Planets was eager for Sol to join its ranks. The Government of Earth and the Outer Solar System \\(GEOSS\\), the system-wide government of Sol, was willing to undertake a loose alliance with their long-lost cousins, the Argon Federation, alone, but declined the offer to join the Community.\\n\\nOther races were hurt by what they saw as a slight against them, and relations slowly began to cool off, but the Jump Gate network once again knew peace, for a short while.","1141":"Tensions Build over AGI Usage","1142":"In the centuries since Nathan R. Gunne destroyed the Jump Gate leading to Sol, Terrans had fostered a deep distrust of any and all artificial intelligence, something that, despite the threat posed by the Xenon, had not been mirrored by the Community of Planets.\\n\\nThe Terrans made it quite clear that they would not allow their mass-produced ships to be artificial intelligently-controlled, nor would they allow artificial intelligently-controlled ships to enter their space. Additionally, they bid the Community to allow computer-controlled ships to be inspected by the AGI Task Force for any potentially dangerous intelligent systems. The Community of Planets refused.\\n\\nStrictly determined that AGI never again become a threat to Sol, the Terran government ordered the USC and ATF to fly into Argon space.","1151":"The Terran Conflict","1152":"The Community of Planets was quick to see the Terran fleet moving through Argon space as an act of aggression, and reacted accordingly. War fell onto the Jump Gate network once again, and thousands more were killed as the Community came to realise just how advanced Terran technology was in comparison to their own.\\n\\nThere was no hope of the Argon Federation being able to defeat the USC in a direct confrontation. Instead, they drew on Terraformer technology developed in secret by the Beryll; new CPU ships and assembler drones were built, with new Jump Gates also built to maintain supply lines.","1161":"The Destruction of the Torus Aeternal","1162":"Saya Kho, serving for some time as an Argon Secret Service agent on Earth, feared greatly that the Terran Conflict would lead to the defeat of her beloved Argon Prime. In the absence of sound alternatives, she was forced to take extreme measures.\\n\\nShe and Sherman Hiatu, an Argon double agent stationed in the Sol system, devised a plan to destroy Earth's last line of defence, the Torus Aeternal, coordinating with the Federal and Beryll fleets to strike the planet as soon as the space station had been removed.\\n\\nIn 778 NT, they put their plan into action. They initiated an emergency procedure known as segment-separation. Torus Aeternal would separate into its constituent 420 segments that drifted into a higher orbit, hereby irrevocably destroying the Torus. Although the number of casualties was low because the segments sealed themselves to act as lifeboats, some individuals in the connecting elements were killed, among them Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu. Neither body was ever found.","1171":"The Flight of the Winterblossom","1172":"With a connection to the vast alien Jump Gate network established in 2042 AD, the scientific community of Earth and the USC worked together to build Earth's first interstellar ship. The entire population of Earth was swept up in an unprecedented level of star-fever and the project took place under immense pressure, but three years after its construction began, in 2046 AD, the USCSS Winterblossom, captained by René Farnham, was ready to face the stars.\\n\\nAfter a two-year journey through the Jump Gate network, the Winterblossom returned to Earth with results suggesting hundreds, possibly thousands of star systems. However, there was no trace of the Gates' builders, or any other intelligent life. Humanity, it seemed then, was alone.","1181":"Warp Instability","1182":"First in -24 NT, connections between all Jump Gates, including those made by Earth, were unexpectedly severed, and then, just as surprisingly, re-established. Terran scouts were the first to realise that the network now had different configuration than before the disconnect.\\n\\nThen, starting during the Terran Conflict, the Jump Gates once again began to destabilise, with Jump Gates opening and closing, first sporadically and then on an almost daily basis before, in 782 NT once again shutting down completely.\\n\\nTheorists suggest that these shutdowns line up with extreme rises in the aggression of the Xenon, or other artificial intelligence threats, and question whether it may be an attempt to slow the destruction of intelligent biological life.","1191":"The Jump Gate Shutdown","1192":"When in 782 NT the Jump Gate network was suddenly disconnected, as every single active Gate suddenly deactivated without warning, the universe was thrown into chaos. Scores of star systems that depended on resources coming in from other territories were thrown into anarchy and war as, in their panic, people fought for survival. Diplomatic relationships and alliances that had stood the test of time were altogether destroyed. The fate of many star systems, and many people, is yet to be uncovered. The Community of Planets, after 268 years, ceased to exist.","1201":"The Alliance of the Word","1202":"In 801 NT, nineteen years after the death of the Community of Planets, messenger drones from Sacred Relic appeared in Argon Prime and Kingdom End, bringing word from the Paranid that they were attempting to find out the reason for the shutdown and send any aid they could. These Paranid called themselves the Alliance of the Word, offering some kind of communication between star systems, even if interstellar travel was no longer possible.\\n\\nThe Alliance of the Word still operates in Sacred Relic to this day, sending automated scouts to systems still trapped outside the newly connected Jump Gate network, in the hope that they may find out who has survived the dark times, and send aid to them if necessary.","1211":"The President's End Massacre","1212":"The Argon colony of President's End had no military ships and a minimal security force when unknown alien ships jumped into the system with the use of fully-functional jump drives. There was barely time to breathe before these same ships opened fire on station and ship alike, tearing the small colony apart in under an hour, jumping away before the nearest Federal fleet could respond.\\n\\nThe Split would go on to name this new threat the Kha'ak, after a folk-tale told to scare children, and the Community of Planets would fight a bitter fight against them for a number of years. President's End never recovered from this onslaught, with ships and stations left to rust where they had been annihilated by the Kha'aks' deadly kyon beam weapons.","1221":"The Battle of Omicron Lyrae","1222":"The most famous battle of the Kha'ak campaign, the Battle for Omicron Lyrae saw Community hero Kyle Brennan unwillingly used to control a devastating Kha'ak M0 battleship, with weapons larger and more terrifying than anything ever seen by the Community of Planets.\\n\\nOnly the intervention of Julian Brennan, Saya Kho and Bret Serra, all named Heroes of the Community of Planets for their efforts, stopped the M0 from destroying the heavily colonised planet of Omicron Lyrae, rescuing Kyle from the clutches of the Kha'ak. While Julian and Saya went on to play important roles in the finding of Earth and the Terran Conflict respectively, Bret was killed in the attempt to rescue Kyle and save the system.","1231":"Operation: Final Fury","1232":"Though the M0-class battleship used by the Kha'ak at the Battle of Omicron Lyrae was destroyed, and no more were seen during the rest of the Kha'ak campaign, the Kha'ak remained a dangerous threat to the Community of Planets for some time. The tide only turned against them when a connection to the Sol Gate was re-established, and the technologically advanced USC fleet were able to stifle the last major Kha'ak offensive.\\n\\nAfter that, the Community of Planets was able to organise a counter-attack against the Kha'ak, using information gathered from Kha'ak ships to locate the hive's point of origin and destroy it. This operation was known as Operation: Final Fury and is seen as the end of the Kha'ak campaign.","1241":"The Gates Reopen","1242":"Though it is impossible to know when the first of the thousands of Jump Gates throughout the universe reopened, or which it was, the first instance recorded by the Alliance of the Word of a reopening was in 803 NT, reconnecting Sacred Relic to Pious Mists \\(then an unexplored system\\). Messenger drones they had sent to nearby systems soon returned with more news of open Gates.\\n\\nFor near to twenty years Jump Gates continued to open and close much as they had before 782 NT, some sporadically opening, closing and reopening to a new location, some turning on and immediately stabilising.","1251":"The Gate Network Stabilises","1252":"In the twenty years after first reports of reopened Jump Gates arrived in Sacred Relic, the Alliance of the Word continued to study Jump Gates and as many unstable warp anomalies as they could for any pattern or reasoning behind the instability of the system.\\n\\nThough they were unable to garner much, they were able to find a noticeable pattern. As time passed, more and more Gates were not only remaining open, but also stable. By 820 NT, they had gathered enough data to be able to confirm publicly that the new Jump Gate network was completely safe to traverse.","1261":"Earth Scientists Create Jump Gates","1262":"In 2022 AD \\(-148 NT\\) Ashizava Kazuko made a startling discovery: it was indeed possible to travel faster than the speed of light with finite energy. Kazuko had successfully established the principle of the tunnel-jump.\\n\\nScepticism was rife, but repeated experiments showed that the previously unknown student was indeed correct. Very soon, two huge Jump Gates were built; one sent to Mars and the other to Proxima Centauri, in humankind's first attempt at interstellar travel.\\n\\nIn 2041, contact with the ship carrying the Proxima Gate was lost, but after a year of frantic research, the Sol Gate once again found a connection. Scientists were stunned to discover that it had not connected with the Proxima Gate, but an unknown Gate in a distant region of the Milky Way.\\n\\nUtterly by chance, humankind had stumbled across an entire network of Jump Gates of unknown origin. It was an invitation that could not be turned down.","1271":"The Terraformer Project is Terminated","1272":"The use of artificially intelligent ships to help in Earth's colonisation efforts sent shockwaves across the scientific community. Many argued the move would drastically accelerate the terraforming process without incurring the resultant increase in construction costs, and it was undeniable that there were huge economic and social benefits to humankind. Others questioned whether the use of truly intelligent machines was in fact slavery. Many were drawn into countless arguments over the definition of sentience.\\n\\nThe Terraformer Project's condemnation though, came in the form of mathematicians and programmers that proved without a doubt that goal drift - changes made to the original programming of the Terraformers caused by machine evolution - could not be ruled out. This, they argued, was a profound danger to intelligent life throughout the galaxy.\\n\\nIn 2099 AD, the World Government ordered that a safe self-destruct program be patched into the First, Second and Third Terraformer Fleets' software, causing the immediate destruction of all Terraformer units."}},"20402":{"title":"Roman Numerals","translations":{"1":"I(speak as 1)","2":"II(speak as 2)","3":"III(speak as 3 etc.)","4":"IV","5":"V","6":"VI","7":"VII","8":"VIII","9":"IX","10":"X","11":"XI","12":"XII","13":"XIII","14":"XIV","15":"XV","16":"XVI","17":"XVII","18":"XVIII","19":"XIX","20":"XX","21":"XXI","22":"XXII","23":"XXIII","24":"XXIV","25":"XXV(speak as 25)"}},"20403":{"title":"Latin Letters","translations":{"1":"A(speak as letter names)","2":"B","3":"C","4":"D","5":"E","6":"F","7":"G","8":"H","9":"I","10":"J","11":"K","12":"L","13":"M","14":"N","15":"O","16":"P","17":"Q","18":"R","19":"S","20":"T","21":"U","22":"V","23":"W","24":"X","25":"Y","26":"Z(speak as zed)","101":"a(speak as letter names)","102":"b","103":"c","104":"d","105":"e","106":"f","107":"g","108":"h","109":"i","110":"j","111":"k","112":"l","113":"m","114":"n","115":"o","116":"p","117":"q","118":"r","119":"s","120":"t","121":"u","122":"v","123":"w","124":"x","125":"y","126":"z(speak as zed)"}},"20404":{"title":"Arabic Numerals","translations":{"1":"1(speak normally as numbers)","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10","11":"11","12":"12","13":"13","14":"14","15":"15","16":"16","17":"17","18":"18","19":"19","20":"20","21":"21","22":"22","23":"23","24":"24","25":"25","30":"30","40":"40","50":"50","60":"60","70":"70","80":"80","90":"90","100":"100(speak as one hundred, translators please localise voice instructions)","1000":"1000(speak as one thousand, translators please localise voice instructions)","1001":"0(speak as zero)","1002":"00(speak as hundred, as said in two hundred, translators please localise voice instructions)","1003":"000(speak as thousand, as said in two thousand, translators please localise voice instructions)","1004":".(speak as point, as in decimal separator, translators please localise voice instructions)","1005":"and(used for combining numbers)"}}}
